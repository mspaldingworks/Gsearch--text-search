DS 1.1- Interested in thesis collaboration
Date: 11/14/11
Recipient: Nancy Hill
Type: Email/ .doc
Abstract:  This communication was sent to establish a relationship between myself and Cylburn Arboretum (henceforth CA).  The language was business-like in tone, and the format of the letter was a variant of a typical letter-of-interest format.   The letter demonstrated a base level understanding the of the history and resources of CA, and hinted vaguely at CA’s “history of engaging multiple communities throughout Baltimore City”.

Abstract-  This was a continuation of the email chain that was seeking to set up an initial meeting before winter break, 2011.  Already I am asking them for forgiveness because I asked to move our meeting time.  I don’t remember why I needed to move the meeting to 2:30, but I know that the reason that I gave “my wife needs the car”, was disingenuous.

	Great to hear from you, Nancy.  I called your office yesterday to try to set something up,  I left a message, but I guess you can disregard it now. I am available anytime you and Susan Patz are free.  I am completely flexible in that regard.  If this is the earliest that you can meet, I understand, however if you have any time during the last week of Nov., please let me know.

	I hope that you both had a great, restful Thanksgiving.  I know that we planned on meeting on the 6th, but I have a full day off Wednesday.  Is it possible to meet Wednesday so that I can get my draft proposal going sooner?  Drafts are due on the 6th, actually, and while I can make that work, I would like to have it done before that point.  I hope it's not too much of an inconvenience, but if you can accommodate my request, I would be grateful.  Either way, I believe that I have some exciting ideas that I can't wait to talk to you about.  Thanks!

	Hi Matt
I know Nancy is out of town this week thru Friday, so I am not sure what her schedule is for the following week. I think you want to meet prior to Dec 6?  I am available on the 5th, but may have to schedule something at the last minute Monday morning when Nancy gets back. I teach from 12-2:30 that day, so before noon or after 2:30 works for me on Monday,

	Thank you for getting back to me Sue. I thought that it might be the case that Nancy had gone out of town. No problem, I can wait until the 6th at 2PM.  Thank you for making an effort to accommodate my request.  It sounds like you are both very busy, and the request was given at very short notice, and I am sorry for that.  I will see you both on Dec. 6th at 2 PM.

	Hi Nancy and Susan,
I am excited for our meeting today.  I have lots of questions to ask you and I think that I am sure that you have lots that you would like to ask me as well.  I did wake up to one problem today.  My wife needed the car today to take my cat to the vet, so I am having to take the bus from class to Cylburn.  I am able to leave class early to accommodate for the additional time for travel, however, today is an important day in our Thesis class and I would like to stay as long as possible before our meeting.  I am asking if it is possible to push our meeting back at all?  It would be convenient for me to meet @ 3 o'clock instead of 2 to accommodate for travel.  I understand if this is not possible.  Please let me know.
Matt

Thanks Jennifer, 
I am teaching a class on biodiversity at MICA this fall and have given my students the assignment of making a "field guide."  Granted, this is no small task, the extent of the guide had been limited to 5 species per student.  (A few students are working in groups, though, so this would up the species number possible....)
I am open to suggestions as to how to proceed.  I think the easiest way might be for you to describe your needs and then I will see if any students are interested in following up.  I think I can oversee most of the student work, but some degree of mentoring (1-2 meetings?) might be necessary on your part.  
I hope this is a good match.  I love the Cylburn; it would be great if the students could help in some way,

Olyssa, I was forwarded your expression of interest in doing a flora/fauna guide to some parks or natural areas around the city (by Valeska Populoh).  I work as a gardener at Cylburn Arboretum, and spoke with some folks who do nature education and they are very interested in this project.  

I have cc'd them in this email:  Nancy Hill, who is our Education Director, and Susan Patz, a member of our Board who leads our Education Committee.  They would be able to fill you in about on-going education programs, and how a guide might fit within (and complement) that effort.

My name is Matt Spalding.  I am a candidate for MICA's Curatorial Practice MFA.  I was referred to you by George Ciscle when he heard about one of my potential Thesis projects.  For my Thesis, I am examining Cylburn Arboretum and looking at the systems (Ecological, historical, social, etc.) that Cylburn is a part of.  I have heard about some of your interests and many of your past projects, particularly your Brightwater project, and I believe that you would be an amazing person to talk with about what I plan to accomplish through this project. Do you have any time this week or next for me to bounce some ideas off of you?  Thanks for your time!

I am happy to talk with you. George may not have mentioned that I am on sabbatical this semester. However, this Friday I will be at MICA to give a lecture for the CAC/MACA/MFACA. I should be done by 10:30 and we could talk then or sometime next week.

Subject: JHU Cylburn collaboration ideas

Dear Nancy,

It was a pleasure meeting you today. I am still overwhelmed by the richness
of Cylburn's natural collections, and the number and variety of possible
projects we discussed.

I wanted to follow up with a summary of our conversation and some suggested
next steps to share with you, Elizabeth Rodini, the Director of the Program
in Museums and Society, and Mary Roby, Executive Director of Cylburn.

Cylburn has three major collections - one of about 250 species of Maryland
birds, one of dried plant specimens - the Herbarium collection -, and, of
course, the living collection of trees and ornamental gardens. Possible
projects for students at Cylburn might include some cataloging and
curatorial work with these collections, to be exhibited either at Cylburn -
such as in the exhibit space of the Vollmer Center or somewhere at JHU - or
online, and working with staff/volunteers at Cylburn to develop programming,
which also might range from producing a "live" experience to a virtual one.

This "collections-based" work can take any of a number of forms, from
identifying and supporting students to work as interns at Cylburn, by
helping develop an internship for which they could receive academic credit,
to developing a course focused on one of these collections whose final
project might be an exhibit or educational program, virtual or physical.

The big challenge for the course idea is to identify the right person to
manage/teach/spearhead the project. As we talked about, undergraduates have
a lot of great energy and ideas, but need someone to structure and lead them
in order to produce a satisfying product.  We could conceive of such a
course as anything from a range of intersession or month-long 1 credit
courses  to the more involved semester-long course. A curatorial course
might develop an exhibit of extinct bird species, or examine the history and
process of collecting natural specimens. A course more focused on
educational programming students might work on everything from developing an
idea for a program through writing a grant to support that program, to
designing promotional materials for it.

A major area of interest for Cylburn would be to develop more web content,
mining some of the rich data from your collections and/or from your recent
GIF (?) surveys. This faces one notable challenge, which would be to find
the appropriate technical support and expertise, and would also require
investigating where the content and its interpretation might be stored, and
the technical specs of that storage. For example, at Hopkins the library
currently supports an exhibition platform called Omeka, and has some space
to host online exhibitions. What about Cylburn? And what level of expertise
and time commitment would be required? Could your "web-master" give us some
indication of that? I can also ask some of our collaborators on digital
humanities projects what kind of time and technical commitment they would
estimate is required.

As we discussed, the next step seems to be identifying the right human
resources both at Cylburn and Hopkins that could help us moving forward. You
were going to get in touch with Sue Katz. Are there others already involved
in, or with an interest in Cylburn that might have the necessary background
and interest? On my end, I will look at what kind of research and teaching
is going on at Hopkins that might fit well with your collections - I think
we can look broadly at both the humanists and scientists (faculty and
advanced graduate students) here to identify some possibilities.

I also think a second useful next step would be to work together to come up
with a description of some internship opportunities at Cylburn that would
satisfy academic credit requirements, and look for students that might be
interested in interning at Cylburn. Can you let me know which people and
upcoming programs/projects in particular might be in need of college student
interns? Or perhaps we could design an internship that rotates through a
number of projects?

Shall we plan for a meeting in a month or so with you, me, Elizabeth Rodini,
Mary Roby and Sue Katz to follow up? That should give me enough time to
touch base with a few more people at Hopkins.

best,

Jennifer

I never heard back whether we are meeting at Spro, (coffee shop in Hampden) this evening at 6:00. I will assume that we are not meeting unless I hear from you, 410-961-7009 or 410-235-4799

	OH GOSH!! I am so sorry Jann!  I got totally caught up in a million different things.  I, for some reason, was under the impression that we were not meeting. I don't have my phone today because I am kind of a mess.   A million apologies, seriously.    
It would work well for me to meet early next semester instead of tonight.  Is that a possibility for you?
Again, I am so sorry.

	Right.  That whole transaction is a pretty poor reflection on me.  It in no way expresses how important I think our interactions can be.  Thank you for agreeing to meet with me next semester.  I really appreciate this second chance.  I hope your holiday season is great, as well.  Thanks again!

I hope the new year is off to a great start.  I would like to set up another opportunity to meet with you.  Do you have time next week at any point?  I am flexible every day, but Wednesday works best for me.  I can meet anywhere that is convenient for you.  Thanks in advance.

	Jann, 
I tried calling this morning to confirm our meeting tonight at Spro in Hampden. I'm not really sure what happened with the phone this morning, but I don't think you could hear me.  I plan to call again so we have verbal confirmation, but I also think that confirming on gmail is important as well, so this is my confirmation.  I am excited to finally meet you!  Thanks again for this opportunity.  I will see you at 5:30
 Matt

	Hi susan and nancy,
Just following up with you about whether we could have a meeting to touch base about my project. I have been developing my ideas and working to develop a thorough proposal. I know that George would like to talk about the project with the 3 of us together. I had asked earlier if the 14th is a date that would work well for you both, but George has asked, for scheduling reasons, if a meeting could happen on the 10th instead?  George and I are both very excited about this project and are looking forward to meeting with you. Thanks!

	Hi Matt
Nancy and I were trying to find a time, 14th didnt work for us as well.  Nancy is unavailable Feb 4-18,  me, Feb 22-March 7.   18th to 21 is only time we are both here in February and I know Nancy's schedule is very tight and she recommended March.   If this can wait til early March that works for us, but we don't want to slow you down either. I will be happy to meet with you on the 10th to see if we are in the same ball park. Then can do our more formal meeting in March when Nancy and I will be able to give you more feedback and may ask you to present to a few others.

Due to our schedule of consecutive absences in Feb. the timing is harder to arrange than usual.  Let me know if you would like to meet with me on the 10th. And I'll see if we can find any time 18-21st, but that looks unlikely right now.

	Susan,
Thanks for the VERY prompt response. I would very much like the chance to meet with you on the 10th. I also like the idea of having a more formal meeting with nancy (and others) at a march date TBD. I would appreciate as much feedback as possible for this peoject, and i think that is a great idea. 
Does the 10th @ 1 work for a meeting between you, me, and george? If so, i will go ahead and confirm with him as well

	HI Matt,
 
Thank you for your recent note.  I am anxious to see your proposal.    The timing is going to be tricky; I will be out of town for the next two weeks and return on the 18th.     The next time I have available is Monday, February 20th at 2 p.m.   If it is necessary to meet before then, I would suggest that you, George and Susan get together.    Please respond to all and let Susan and me know how you would like to proceed.    
 
See you soon.
 
Nancy

	THESIS PARTNER MEETINGS:
1. Initial Partner meeting ideally should include the 2 members of your Review Committee.  Priority for scheduling is the member from your Partner site.
You are welcome to also invite staff members from partner , advisory /mentoring/resource people you intend to be involved at various levels of participation


2.  Proposals are still in progress and not due until the end of the month . However, you need to update the current version considering the feedback from Writing Studio.                This is  a "Working Draft " and should be titled so on each page  of the document. Email this to everyone scheduled to be at your meeting at least 2 days beforehand for their review and confirm that they have received it . We don't want to spend our time during the meeting with them reading it.

	Hey Jann,
Thank you so much for the meeting last week. I feel that the feedback and advice that you gave was fantastically practical and useful.  You gave me a lot to think about and our talk helped me focus on many options that I hadn't thought to explore.  I cannot stress enough how grateful I am that you donated your time and attention to my project.  It is ambitious and still needs lots of help but our talk was a good place to reassess a lot of my goals.  I hope that you can find the time in the future to contribute more of your invaluable input.  Thanks again!

I can work around your schedule this week everyday except Friday after 12 and Wednesday before 3.  When do you have openings?

Look forward to talking.

	Suzanne,
Unfortunately I won't be able to meet at either of these time this week.  I have a GTI on Wednesday and Thursday I am not able to get away from our seminar discussion because we are reviewing applicants to the program.   Do you have any availability next week?  I have a review committee for this project on Friday and I am sure they are going to tear the project apart.  Maybe you can help me clean up they mess they will leave in their wake.  please let me know when works best for you.  Thanks!
Matt

	Hey Matt, 
Next week I could meet you on Tuesday, Feb 14th, at 11:30 am for a half an hour. I have class at 1 pm. The rest of the week is booked. Will that work for you? Let me know. If not, we will have to move on to the next week.
Best,
Suzanne

Nancy and my emails crossed paths tonite. 
Looks like Nancy is able to meet with us on the 20th.  If 20th at 2 works for you and George, let's do it.

Susan,
Thanks for the VERY prompt response. I would very much like the chance to meet with you on the 10th. I also like the idea of having a more formal meeting with nancy (and others) at a march date TBD. I would appreciate as much feedback as possible for this peoject, and i think that is a great idea. 
Does the 10th @ 1 work for a meeting between you, me, and george? If so, i will go ahead and confirm with him as well

Hi Matt
Nancy and I were trying to find a time, 14th didnt work for us as well.  Nancy is unavailable Feb 4-18,  me, Feb 22-March 7.   18th to 21 is only time we are both here in February and I know Nancy's schedule is very tight and she recommended March.   If this can wait til early March that works for us, but we don't want to slow you down either. I will be happy to meet with you on the 10th to see if we are in the same ball park. Then can do our more formal meeting in March when Nancy and I will be able to give you more feedback and may ask you to present to a few others.

Due to our schedule of consecutive absences in Feb. the timing is harder to arrange than usual.  Let me know if you would like to meet with me on the 10th. And I'll see if we can find any time 18-21st, but that looks unlikely right now.

Hi susan and nancy,
Just following up with you about whether we could have a meeting to touch base about my project. I have been developing my ideas and working to develop a thorough proposal. I know that George would like to talk about the project with the 3 of us together. I had asked earlier if the 14th is a date that would work well for you both, but George has asked, for scheduling reasons, if a meeting could happen on the 10th instead?  George and I are both very excited about this project and are looking forward to meeting with you. Thanks!

	I haven't gotten a hold of George yet, so I am not sure if the 20th will work for him.  I am calling him after I get out of class today so I will know this afternoon if that is okay.  If not, then the 10th after 1:30 is still our best option.  I'll keep you posted.  Thanks!
Matt




Matt
You didn't confirm this timing until I received your draft yesterday. I can still meet with you, but without running some of these ideas by more of our staff I would only be able to give you my impressions of your goals and what is doable. What will be key is the city's buy in to your thesis work. Thus it will be good to have all ducks in a row when you present to them.  I will ask one other person if they are able to meet with us tomorrow. may include one more person in tomorrow's meeting. 


No location was chosen, so I will invite you to Cylburn at 1:30 the Vollmer Ctr (new building). Please confirm time and place.
sue


BTW  Your thesis proposal looks rather extraordinary (and huge).  Now to make this work for all organizations and you.

Would you mind sharing with me who you choose before tomorrow so I can understand in what context this person will be viewing this project?

The draft is much larger than it needs to be.  I am throwing out many ideas and expect lots of them to be cut, and also I would like to see how I can better serve the city and Cylburn.   Luckily, this is still a few stages out from a final draft, so bring your hatchets and lets cut this thing down!  

Thanks so much, Susan.  Cylburn tomorrow at 1:30 will be perfect.  George and I will meet at the mansion.  Thanks!

Hi Matt
Tomorrow with the absence of Nancy and being a casual but hopefully very helpful meeting for you, I have asked our Education Program Manager to sit in on our meeting. She has been recently hired and works closely with Nancy.  and she is a MICA grad.


Ck email for location tomorrow. The city has to give me a heads up on available space to meet, but I think the mansion has NO assigned meetings. 
They will let me know sometime tomorrow AM.

I sent you the information I had on interpretive learning a couple of days ago and am just checking to see if you received it. My email seems to be dropping emails that I’ve sent with things attached to them but showing me that they were successfully sent. Just let me know either way and if you didn’t get it I can try to send it again, or I can send it from another email.

	This is the current working draft of my thesis project.  I sent it to both of you, although I know that you can't both meet on the 10th.  There is a lot to revise.  It needs more focus and I would like it to reflect your needs more, and I hope we can work toward that goal together!. Thanks for reading!!

I wanted to touch base to see whether you met on the 10th.  It was unclear whether the meeting was confirmed for the 10th or 20th.  You may have already met with Sue and George.    I just learned that Cylburn is closed tomorrow for Presidents’ Day.    What is your schedule like for Tuesday afternoon, the 21st?     3 p.m.?       Please let me know and please weigh in, Sue.
 
Thanks.

	Hey George,
At my meeting yesterday with Nancy Hill I found out about the Greater Baltimore Children and Nature Collaborative conference that is happening tomorrow at Cylburn.  Originally I was told that registration was closed and attendance was at capacity, but now I hear that they can make room.  It will cover topics such as, but not limited to:

Nature Place Spaces with Julie Dieguez and Sandi Olek
Green Mapping and Discovering Druid Hill Park with Janet Felsten
Look But Don't Touch and Enjoy: Reclaiming Baltimore's Water for Inner-City Youth with Judd Anderson
Learning the Science of Nature throughout Art and Exploration with Molly Hoopes
Students as Citizen Scientists with Elena Takaki
Using Your Urban Assets with Joanne Schmader
Connecting Downtown Families to Outdoor Activities and Families Exploring Nature with Patrick Gutierrez and Ryan Patterson
Exploring Your Environment with Digital Video Making with Dwayne Muphy
Storywalk: Families Learning and Playing Outside with Anne Ferguson

Considering I am now looking at designing curriculum for 2 three hour classes, I think that this is a great opportunity to begin networking with potential guests or to start considering topics that I otherwise wouldn't have known about.  I also saw Derrick Adams speak last year when I was a post-bacc.  What do you think?

	What amazing developments the proposal has taken since our meeting at CAA!
It is good to see how focused and clear this has become, esp. in your mission and goals now.
Your newly defined partners have direct relevance and relationship to the project and CAA at the same time.
In the "envisioned project" you need to clarify the anticipated roles and responsibilities you see the students , both MICA and Digital H.S. taking on.
Under assessment, you still need to further explain how you foresee thesis' goals and outcomes  being evaluated.
Audience is now targeted, appropriate  and manageable
Good to see sustainability includes future for the partners who have been engaged by this.

	Hi Jann,
We talked earlier this semester about my project at Cylburn Arboretum and your feedback was incredible.  It was far and away superior to much of the other feedback that I got from many of the other people that I had looking at the project.  I really value your opinion and would, therefore, respectfully request that you join my review committee for this project. 
My review committee thus far consists of George Ciscle, Nancy Hill and Susan Patz (both from Cylburn).  They have all agreed to contribute a few hours of their time at meetings that occur a couple times a semester.  I have made serious revisions to my project based on your suggestions and would appreciate your input in this project going forward.  
Would you consider joining my review committee?  If so, I would like to send you the most updated draft version of my thesis on the 28th.  We will have about a month to tweak the draft before it is submitted as the final version.  
Thanks in advance for your consideration!
Matt

I am very flattered by your request. Perhaps you forgot that  I am on sabbatical until September 2012. Normally I would be happy to join your committee, however under the circumstances this is not possible. If you remain in need of a committee member in the fall, I would be happy to assist you.

	Hi Jann,
I hope your sabbatical is going well, I know you are very busy.  I have heard that you have a big project running through May  I recently met Ryan Patterson, who I believe is working with you on your project.   It sounds like an exciting project.I hope it's going well!

George and I recently met to discuss the progress of my Thesis project at Cylburn.  We agreed that you are the ideal candidate to advise on my project, so in the hopes of accommodating your busy schedule, would you be willing to read my proposal and send back commentary?  We understand that you are busy and probably wouldn't be able to meet with the committee this semester.  However, we are still both interested in having you participate fully in the review committee for the 2013 school year so we feel it is important to involve you in the early stages of this project as well.

I have attached my most recent draft, which has come a long way since our last meeting.  The mission and goals are much more focused, and I have also created lots of open space for exploration around my concept.  If you are able, I would very much appreciate your written feedback and commentary, but either way, thanks as always for your time!

	Hi Matt
My project is going well; much more slowly than I would like. May is just six weeks away and I am not sure how I pull everything together, so I have my nose to the grindstone.
Attached is your draft with some written comments. Overall, I agree that you are more focused.  However, there remains several big questions that need to be answered. I hope this helps and look forward to working with you next Fall. 
Jann

HI Suzanne!
First of all, i want to thank you for your previous guidance and advice in regard to my project. I am on firmer ground as far as the development of my proposal is concerned, but I still need lots of help to ensure that this project is feasible yet still resonant.  Do you have time to meet about my priject once more this semester? I am transitioning into designing the course pitch and would like to get your feedback on the zcope and language of the class. Do you have time this week or next? Please let me know your availability.  Thanks again.
Matt


Matt, Sounds great. will be happy to meet with you again. Let me check my calendar. Am going into class right now.

Good for you for all these activities. Your life sounds rich.

DS 1.32 Student names from Art Meets Ecology
Date- 4/1/12

Abstract- This email was to send me contact information in order to help me develop my classes through the use of student testimonials.  
Full Text-
Hey Matt, 
Here are a few names of students who were in Jennifer's and my class. The information is uneven, but, after going through my records, it was the best I could do. Hope it helps.


Amy Beverungen  abeverungen@mica.edu  Amy is an art history major and is in her junior year. She is available through her email and I am sure will be helpful.
Jonathan Taube  Took the course in Fall 08 when he was a junior. Don't know where he is, but was an outstanding 
student who pushed the limits of everything.
Kyle L. DeLotto (0401176)  Also took the course in Fall 08. He and Jonathan Taube worked together on a Wiki site
for their project. Don't know where he is either.
Matt R. Lohry (0406691)  Took the course in Fall 09. I think he is currently in China, but George knows him and may 
have some leads on an address/email.
Justine R. Smith (0434960)  Took the course in fall 09. I believe Justine is graduating this May. therefor she should be easy to contact.


I think with the student ID numbers, you should be able to locate most of these folks. Pleae keep me in the loop and let me know how you are progressing. Would love to know what the "stations/themes" are once you decide.
I think it is an exciting challenging project.
Best,
Suzanne

Hi George Ciscle, 


I looked over the list and the ones that look the most interesting are James E. Lewis, Cylburn Arboretum, Home-Based Residency Project and Globe Posters: Not To Be Missed. I like those four the most because of there involvement with the community and forms of are that I'm interested in. I would also be fine interning with the other grad but i found those four the most interesting.

	Hey guys,
It is really important for us to come up with a date to meet to discuss the state of my thesis so that we can ensure that it is in a good place in preparation for the Summer.  The end of the semester is rapidly approaching, and we need to look over things like a timeline, a budget, and the scope and mission of the project.  It is also really important to spend some time looking at the curriculum of the two classes that are being developed in conjunction with the project.
I understand that the Spring is a busy time at Cylburn, but I am concerned that I have been sending emails to you both and have not gotten a response on many of the emails.  I haven't stalled on the development of my thesis, but the progress has been stymied by a lack of communication.  I have Cc'd George onto this email so that he is aware of our current situation and can help us to figure out the date of our combined meeting.
Please email me at your earliest convenience to finalize a date for our meeting in preparation for the end of my semester.  Thanks!
Matt

Nancy is out of town til Wed.  We have a joint meeting scheduled that day and this will be a priority for us. We will throw some dates back to you and George Wed. My responses have been slow due to family and taxes. These personal priorities are in the past now.  Our slow response is no indication that we are not very excited by your project and not representative of our usual cxns.  With apologies.

	I have a 1:30 meeting at MICA which will go close to 3:00. If it ends before that we can be there a bit earlier.
Another option would be for both of you to come to MICA at 3:00, unless of course Nancy's meeting is at Cylburn already.
Please advise. Unfortunately, with only another week of school left I don't see the possibility of re-scheduling.

Hope you have had a wonderful summer.

We would like to confirm with you- scope of your project and ask you about potential change in your show schedule.  So let's get together to learn of the progress you've made and to assure that we are on the same page.  As you begin the intensive process of thesis completion, we want to make sure that all the pieces, city permissions, etc are all in place.

Thanks.

	hi george and matt - 


thanks for stopping by the gallery on saturday!


we just sent out an email about a talk we're giving there this saturday (you've pretty much heard it already, just fyi).  we're also happy to meet any students who you think might be interested - if anything crosses your mind(s) just let us know and we'll set things up. i also wanted to touch base with you, matt, about meeting some of my students in the space.  


my classes meet on tuesday/thursday nights (4-10pm) - i think both classes would be interested in the works, and it would be great if you'd like to be involved.  i'm thinking that the 11/13 (either/or - around 7pm) would be good nights to bring them over, if you're available then please let me know.


looking forward.


best,
james + lili

	first of all, thanks again for showing me the work. I appreciate you giving your time and energy to show it to me.
I like the idea of bringing the classes over, it is best for me on the 13th. Unfortunately, I will not be able to come this Saturday to the talk but I would like to stop by to ask a little bit about these classes that I will be showing the work to. 
Where is your office, and do you mind if I just pop in and ask a question or two?

sorry for the delay - this week was really busy.


glad to chat with you about something on the 13th.  my office is BR312, and i'll be there between 3-4 this tuesday, if that works?  otherwise, perhaps we can chat on the phone.


my thursday class meets from 4-10, i was thinking of bringing them over after dinner, around 7pm, just for about 20 mins.


they're mostly sophomores just beginning to learn about art + technology.  they have their first crit on tuesday at 4pm - two simple projects each w/ arduino.


hope all is well,

Full Text-
Begin forwarded message:

Hi George,


Hope you are doing well and the school year is off to a great start! I'm going on vacation Friday, but I wanted to let you know that Jess will be bringing a "form" for your students to fill out as we get ready to promote their individual exhibitions in the spring. I'm attaching a draft here, which I'm hoping you could look over to make sure I'm not missing anything. Jess can clarify things further at the meeting, but we're hoping students can work with the host sites to identify the best media contacts and write a brief "elevator pitch"-style statement about their exhibition. All of the information will be used in our press releases, in Juxtapositions, and on mica.edu.


I plan to send the students the form digitally, mainly because they'll be submitting pictures, too (and I'm guessing their handwriting could be hard to read!). However, Jess can bring hard copies so the students have something to take to their host sites. 


Please let me know if you have any questions and I'm sorry I can't be at there Monday to meet with the students!

We need to receive from you one page that includes the information listed below.
We will forward this info to Cylburn Arboretum's City Manager (Chief Horticulturalist for Baltimore CIty Rec and Parks), Melissa Grimm, who needs to have this info to confirm each detail -Arboretum placement and the city calendar.

A title
brief summary of your thesis project
location of project placement at Cylburn (please attach a map with locations noted)
time frame of "exhibition"
time frame needed for set up
time frame to take down
your contact info
George's contact info or your MICA advisor (s)

The writing should be clear and appropriate to the lay person (like me).  If more words are needed to describe your project, it is more important that we understand your work, vs. sticking to the one page limit.

Thank you.

	Hi Sue,
In the course of writing my one page summary, I found out about a little bit of trouble with my proposed classes at MICA.  It is leading me to rethink my project and am writing a plan B.  I will have to hammer out the details this week, but I am wondering if I can talk out a few ideas with you this week.  Do you have time to meet in person?  Anytime this week is ideal so that I can complete the summary of the project that your require.  Let me know, I am quite nervous about this project at the moment and need to talk it out with you.

	Dear Matt,

I am confirming our one-on-one meeting for next week, Monday, October 8 from 1-2pm. I will meet you at your office/studio in the graduate studio center. 

During this meeting, please bring me up to date on your progress on your thesis. If you have anything in writing outlining your thesis project proposal (beyond the one paragraph summary) that would be helpful to send to me in advance, please do so. Additionally if you have any questions that you specifically want me to be able to address, you can send those along as well (though you can ask away during our meetings as well). As always, if you have anything that you would like feedback, comments, or edits on, please send to me at least 24hs in advance - this will probably be more helpful as the year progresses, but I am always willing to assist if needed.

As a reminder from our first "speed date" meeting, please be prepared to go over the following with me when we meet:
- The goals you have established for your thesis. Your goals should be measurable and aligned with a) your audience and b) the evaluation and assessment you will conduct. You may have goals for the exhibition itself, partnerships, and/or programs.
- A clear definition of who your audience is. You may have primary, secondary, and/or tertiary audiences. Please tell me as much as you can about your audience and be prepared to explain why they will care about/be involved with/be important to your thesis (please excuse the crassness, however I will always ask you "why?" and "so what?") When we talked about audience, I gave you the assignment to think about who they are (explicitly), what you will do to serve their specific needs (and how much), and how you will know if they are better off because of what you have done. 
- A clear outline of all audience-centered elements related to your thesis. This could include: interpretive materials such as guides, tours, AV, etc.; exhibition language, signage, etc.; programs and educational events. 

If you have any questions please let me know. 

I'll look forward to seeing you soon!
Best,

	Hi James,
I am planning my thesis for the Spring and have run into a couple snags that are preventing me from reaching my goals.  It has become ABUNDANTLY clear that I lack the technical expertise to design the interface systems that are essential for the audience experience that I am trying to create.  Are there any Juniors or Seniors in your department who may have an interest in collaborating on my thesis project?  If so, I would like to sit and discuss the details of what I am specifically looking to create.  Thanks!  I hope all is well.

	George,
I've thought about some steps that can be taken to alleviate the current situation.  I think that before anything is agreed upon, I'd like to hear some feedback from you to determine if further actions need to be considered on my part.  What led to this point was a complexity of forces, but they all need to get sorted out urgently.  That is on me, not on you.  Therefore, I propose the following steps:
* Revised thesis proposal delivered to you and my partner by Tuesday Oct. 16th
       *Including budget, timeline, mission and goals
- I am not sure that Jann is the best person for my review committee considering that I am now considering a change in focus.  I may have to find a new person for my review committee.  Once you see the new direction I am going to take, please let me know if you think Jann or someone new is more appropriate.
* Bi- Weekly emails on Friday to you and Susan Patz updating you about specific steps taht have been taken in the past two weeks to forward my thesis
* Hours at the studio matching your office hours (Wednesday 9-12) every week... No matter what my appearance is.
* Also, it might seem gimicky, but I will create a visual representation for how I am feeling that I will have in my studio.  I'm envisioning a pit that I can move someone up or down depending on how overwhelmed I feel at the time.
* To prioritize time, I will create a 4 quadrant grid with all of my tasks in my studio.  The x-axis will align with importance and the y-axis will align with urgency.  I would like it if you review this chart with me on Wednesdays.
What do you think?  is this enough?

to george 
 https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/images/cleardot.gif 

	

	I see two places where I failed to meet expectations as pointed out from your email.  I'd like to address them here.

First- You're right.  I missed my imposed deadline by at least a day.  Here is my revised thesis, thus far- I am missing a revised timeline and budget.  Those will come by Monday (Hard deadline).  I need to meet deadlines with my thesis, especially considering my current predicament.

Secondly, I did not come to the studio this morning, as you noted.  I would like to explain that I do not have Wednesday classes and, therefore, worked under the assumption that I was still on Fall Break... That's beside the point.  Missing office hours was a failure, but I should have passed along the information that I was going to be out of town for my first studio hours.  The failure was, yet again, a failure to communicate... So far, not off to a good start.  I'll do better and shouldn't have a reason to miss studio hours for the foreseeable future.  If something comes up, I'll let you know.  


See you at CP reflection.

As I spoke to you earlier, I would be unavailable for the latter part of October.  Thus this Oct 15 email I have not seen til now (Oct 22).


IMMEDIATELY contact your press office and TAKE MY CELL NUMBER OFF any contact info.  I am the site media person, but USE THE OFFICE PHONE TO REACH ME!  410-367-2217.  To work with you in a most productive way I have given you my personal cell #.   It is for family and my personal work with others as needed and as I distribute.  NOT IN PRINT EVER.


If it is not too late- I will try to write a better mission statement for the Arboretum and you should acknowledge Balto City Parks and Cylburn Arboretum Association for making this project possible.


More later, I am not in regular contact til November.  BUT YOU MUST GET MY CELL OUT OF PRESS.   And I'll finish reading this document you sent. but had such a stong rxn to the cell number in print.


I am not furious with you re: this--- just want to get it fixed ASAP.  nbd but you must make sure it does not printed.


thx
sue

Hi Justin,
My name is Matt Spalding and I am a grad student in curatorial practice currently pulling together what is sure to be a fantastic thesis project. I lack some skill and imagination required to pull of what I would like to do, though. I asked James rouvelle to recommend a stellar student in his program who might be good to collaborate with, and he said that you would be a good fit!
I understand that you are in high demand these days, but I wonder if you have time to meet up to discuss this thesis and to see if we can form a fruitful collaboration. 
Can I buy you lunch to talk things over? Please let me know when/if you're available. Thanks!

Sorry It took me so long to get back to you. I am extremely busy this semester, but you've piqued my interest and I can never refuse free food. I may be able to help out, depending upon the size of the role you're envisioning/what exactly it would entail. A Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday afternoon would be best if you want to meet up.

Please confirm both.

@ the Trails is an online app that explores the new role that technology plays in how humans experience the world by presupposing technology is fundamentally changing the way humans experience the world. The exhibition uses Cylburn Arboretum’s existing collections of trails, trees, gardens, etc. as subject matter to explore the myriad ways that humans form a relationship to nature. Through the experience of a newly created app designed specifically for use at Cylburn Arboretum, @ the Trails investigates how technology supplements the experience of the arboretum and its various collections, as well as how technology can hinder the experience of nature.

	George, I sent out an email to Lili and Susan about changing out meeting time from 2:30 to 3, but they haven't responded yet. If i don't get a response i have to assume we're meeting at 2:30 still. In which case i won't bed able to have Justin with us. so unless i hear from them, we should meet at 2:30. I'll keep you posted if i hear anything, otherwise I'll see you at 2:30

I am available. Early afternoon better than late, but I'll try to coordinate wf Lili's timing. 


Still waiting to receive your summary description that we can share wf city park chief, Melissa, to share project final content and needs and lock in calendar dates for you with city. When you sent earlier email it only contained your Mfacp page.

	I would like to bring a collaborator on the development of the app to the meeting so that you can all meet.  His name is Justin Livi and it is important that he talk with you all to develop content for the app.  He can't meet until 3.  Does 3 pm work for you all as well?   Susan, I understand that you can't meet after 4 pm, so we will try to be efficient with this meeting.  Does this work for you all?

Also, I have attached my latest proposal.  If you have time to glance it over before our meeting today, I suggest spending extra time on the mission, partners, and programming.  I will have printed copies for you all at the meeting as well.  If you don't get the chance to look it over, we can talk about the most recent changes at our meeting.  See you both later today!  Let me know if 3 works or if we should just stick to 2:30

	Hi William,
I had a meeting with Lili Levy and Susan Patz last night about my thesis plan.  I would really like to talk to you about how we can collaborate on the upcoming Cylburn App.  I am forming a network of students in the arts and development fields to investigate how to create a uniquely engaging user experience on the app platform.  Would you be willing to get together with myself and a couple other people involved on the project to compare notes?  When is convenient for you?  I understand you must be very busy considering your major in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, but if you are free anytime before the end of the semester, I would love to have a meeting of minds around the upcoming Cylburn app.  I am up for any atmosphere ranging from lunch to drinks (coffee or otherwise).

	Hi James, 
I am writing an internship for Justin Livi for next semester.  I would like to pursue this as a for-credit independent study for the spring semester worth 3 credits so I need to work with you to determine an appropriate workload for Justin for this independent study.  I've gotten started on a preliminary list of things Justin would gain from this independent study.  Can you please review it and send back suggestions as soon as you are able?  Thanks in advance!

Also, because I am writing an internship for Justin Livi as a part of my thesis project, I am curious if you would like to sit in on a review of my thesis this Thursday at 2 PM on-site at Cylburn Arboretum?  If you can make it, I would like to forward you my Thesis plan for you to take a look at.  Thanks again!  I hope all is well.

	Hey guys,
It would be great if we could all get together before things end for the December/ New Year holidays.  Pushing it as close to the end of the semester as possible, I think a time/date that might work well is Dec. 13th at 3:30 pm.  Does that work for everyone?  Let me know if you can fit this into your schedules so we can get this time scheduled earlier than it has traditionally been done.  Thanks!
Matt

	Not sure if you're interested, but on the education side of things this seems useful:  
http://www.ted.com/talks/alan_kay_shares_a_powerful_idea_about_ideas.html

And then I grew up with this:
http://www.billnye.com/for-kids-teachers/episode-guides/

This is cool, but not immediately applicable.  I can think of the applications, but they are all too impossible for this project.  Still...:

	Yeah I'd seen the Alan Kay's video and read a decent amount of his writing. I'm not sure I agree with the idea that computers belong in the classroom, but I like the general approaches he takes, making education more engaging.


Bill Nye was definitely one of my favorite shows growing up (along with the magic school bus, zoom, and all those other great PBS shows). It will be interesting to see how all of these ideas come together. What are you hoping for going into the meeting?


Also, any progress in terms of the developer(s)?

	Hello Matt 
I can make a 3:30 mtg on the 13th.  


Attachment below is a brief summary that I made a year or two ago that quotes the COMAR regulatory framework, the mandatory standards for Md Schools, and goal -6.B.1 (one of many MSDE grade specific accomplishments needed in Environmental Education). This should help you with a rationale for linking your project with grade specific goals that teachers must accomplish and help in your conversation with the school principal.


Note: There are many more MdVSC standards that can be utilized in EE for  younger grades. See them on the BCPS website and select what you feel most appropriate.  Also for some reason, I have the United Nations definition of Environmental Education in this summary. Not sure which grant I was writing when accumulating this info.  


This should help you. 
Susan

	Hi William,
I had a meeting with Lili Levy and Susan Patz last night about my thesis plan.  I would really like to talk to you about how we can collaborate on the upcoming Cylburn App.  I am forming a network of students in the arts and development fields to investigate how to create a uniquely engaging user experience on the app platform.  Would you be willing to get together with myself and a couple other people involved on the project to compare notes?  When is convenient for you?  I understand you must be very busy considering your major in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, but if you are free anytime before the end of the semester, I would love to have a meeting of minds around the upcoming Cylburn app.  I am up for any atmosphere ranging from lunch to drinks (coffee or otherwise).   Let me know, and I look forward to meeting you soon!

	Hi William, 
This is Matt Spalding again.  I'm not sure if you saw my last email considering how close it was sent before the Thanksgiving Holiday.  I case you didn't see it, I will summarize;  
I am a grad student working in Curatorial Practice at MICA.  I am working with artists and developers to create a virtual interactive exhibition for Cylburn to occur in the late Spring.  I saw that you are currently developing an app for Cylburn and I was hoping that I meet with you to talk out a few details and compare notes on the app.  
Do you have time this week or next to get together?  It's on me!

	Hi Matt,

Sorry about that, I thought I had responded to you, but I think the email got stuck in my outbox.  I would be glad to meet with you about that and you can see the prototype of the app.  It is a pretty simple app as of right now, as I am still getting some of the features to work.  Just send me a text or give me a call and we can work out a time and place to meet up.  I can meet either this weekend or next week(preferably Tuesday or Thursday), but Thursday and Friday this week aren't good for me.

Thanks


Weird that I just now saw this email.  Do you have time this weekend?  Any day/time

Abstract- This email was in response to the inquiry that I had made for a close of the semester meeting with my entire Thesis committee.  I invited everyone involved with the project up to this point.  Susan sent me MdVSC Standards so I could frame the conversation I would be having with the schools that I was approaching to partner with.

In the email dated on the 11/19/12 I mentioned my hope that we could schedule a meeting earlier than it has traditionally been done.  I did not send a follow-up email with any of the people who did not confirm.

Hello Matt 
I can make a 3:30 mtg on the 13th.  


Attachment below is a brief summary that I made a year or two ago that quotes the COMAR regulatory framework, the mandatory standards for Md Schools, and goal -6.B.1 (one of many MSDE grade specific accomplishments needed in Environmental Education). This should help you with a rationale for linking your project with grade specific goals that teachers must accomplish and help in your conversation with the school principal.


Note: There are many more MdVSC standards that can be utilized in EE for  younger grades. See them on the BCPS website and select what you feel most appropriate.  Also for some reason, I have the United Nations definition of Environmental Education in this summary. Not sure which grant I was writing when accumulating this info.  


This should help you. 
Susan

	Hi William,
I had a meeting with Lili Levy and Susan Patz last night about my thesis plan.  I would really like to talk to you about how we can collaborate on the upcoming Cylburn App.  I am forming a network of students in the arts and development fields to investigate how to create a uniquely engaging user experience on the app platform.  Would you be willing to get together with myself and a couple other people involved on the project to compare notes?  When is convenient for you?  I understand you must be very busy considering your major in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, but if you are free anytime before the end of the semester, I would love to have a meeting of minds around the upcoming Cylburn app.  I am up for any atmosphere ranging from lunch to drinks (coffee or otherwise).   Let me know, and I look forward to meeting you soon!

	Hi William, 
This is Matt Spalding again.  I'm not sure if you saw my last email considering how close it was sent before the Thanksgiving Holiday.  I case you didn't see it, I will summarize;  
I am a grad student working in Curatorial Practice at MICA.  I am working with artists and developers to create a virtual interactive exhibition for Cylburn to occur in the late Spring.  I saw that you are currently developing an app for Cylburn and I was hoping that I meet with you to talk out a few details and compare notes on the app.  
Do you have time this week or next to get together?  It's on me!

DS 1.69 Developer
Date- 12/3/12
Recipient- 
from: Justin Livi <silaslivi@gmail.com> to: Matthew Spalding <mspalding@mica.edu>
Type- Email
Abstract- This email chain was sent by Justin to confirm that his internship was going to happen as planned.  It was an email chain that discussed the urgency of finding a developer.  The email first established that I needed to find a developer before Justin would sign onto the project.  The email first establishes that I did not find a developer in time, and then I offered a proposal for how he could stay on the project and still complete his schedule for the next semester.  Further, I gave him the Independent Study Contract, and suggested we meet up with James Rouvelle soon to complete the contract.

	Justin, I regret to report that I have been unsuccessful thus far finding one.  I met with one person, but he didn't have the skills we need.  Beyond that I have reached out to several people, including Andy three times, but haven't heard anything back from them. I originally gave them some time because of the Thanksgiving break, but it has been over a week since life should have started up for everyone again.  Therefore, I have decided to go ahead and reach out through other means as well, so I am posting up a craigslist ad, as well as continuing to follow other leads I have learned about. because I am getting pretty desperate to find someone with the skills we need.  

I am sensitive to the fact that the deadline to sign up from classes is RAPIDLY approaching, as is D-day next week with my review committee.  Here's what I recommend to go forward-

Sign up for your course list as normal as if this weren't going to happen so you are covered.

HOWEVER, I have attached the Independent course form, so lets go ahead and fill it out with James Rouvelle.  If, at any point, you feel like you need to pull out, you can do this up to the final drop day at the beginning of next semester.  If I am successful pulling all of this together, though, you should go ahead and drop whatever the course is that this was going to take the place of.  

Does that make sense?  Hopefully this will allow you to move forward with your planning so that you are covered, just in case.

	Awesome! I'm excited :D


It's kind of funny cause I have an intern next semester helping me with my thesis too. Actually on that note, my advisor had me write up a week-by week schedule with goals and deadlines for her, kind of like a syllabus. This not only helps her know what to expect and plan for what needs doing, but also helped me figure out exactly what I needed her to do and even helped me solidify my personal schedule for thesis. Anyway I was hoping you could write up the same kind of thing for me cause it would really help a lot with planning and such.


Anyway, I'm excited to meet with you and the developer soon :)


Thanks!

	Hi Joe,
I am really impressed with your experience and you sound like the type of developer who knows how to get things done.  I would love to talk with you about the details of this project and your role within it.  In fact, I have scheduled a meeting between myself, my artist, and one assistant tomorrow evening (location TBD).  If you are central to Baltimore and available, I would like to invite you to come to this meeting.  It will be an opportunity to introduce you to the plan that I have developed, and the rest of the team tat I have assembled.  After that, we can move forward by establishing whether or not you are still interested in working on the project, and if so, your compensation.   Let me know if you can make it, and if you have a preference for venue.  Looking forward to hearing back from you.
Matt Spalding

I'll have a short presentation about the project and then we can talk about how to move forward.  Coffee is on me and after the meeting we can discuss money.  Let me know if you can be there.  502-552-5981
Best,

	Hello All
I spoke with my son Ben tonight and he said:

1--iPhone 4 - will work completely minus the cell phone piece.
2-- will connect with internet using wi-fi for sure
3--not sure if bluetooth is on the iPnone4   he said, just do the field research. try it.
4-- if not bluetooth, could connect to the GPS app instead.  and test the connectivity of that on site too. the GPS app should be good to 10 ft. so it will get ya close enough and doesnt require a bluetooth source

So this is good news. Just need to charge up old iphones and use with bluetooth, wi-fi, or via GPS app.  Not sure if the GPS app will give you live web connection tho??

Matt
Please don't forget to get a simple description of your work to me before you leave. You could talk about connecting via GPS app. for now. Might be simplest to understand and doesnt need a server/ transmitter on site. (Doesn't finalize this method.)

Looking forward to continuing working with all-

	I'm hitting the road today.  Let me know if this is a sufficient description or if you'd like more information.

@ the Trails is a MFA Curatorial Practice thesis exhibition that will educate, engage, and inspire.  Through the use of an Iphone application that synchronizes with Bluetooth devices and temporary outdoor signage, visitors will learn about a significant part of Cylburn Arboretum’s tree collection.  Concurrently, data from the use of the app will be harnessed by artist Justin Livi to generate a series of digital artworks to be displayed online and as part of the rotating slideshow at the Vollmer visitor center.  The @ the Trails app will explore the emerging role that technology plays in bridging the gap between people and their environment by using the grounds of Cylburn Arboretum as the location for an artfully interactive experience.

	Matt:


It was good meeting you yesterday and learning more about your ideas for the iPhone application.  I look forward to helping make this application a reality for you and learning more about iPhone development in the process.  When you have a chance please put me in contact with the guy that will be the lead developer on this project so that I can start talking with him also.


I have included my friend Ryan in on this e-mail.  I mentioned that he has some web space that could potentially be utilized for data storage and for the website.  He also can help with graphic design for this app as necessary.  


Anyway good meeting you and I look forward to working with you in the coming months on this application.

Hi Matt,

I just left you a voice mail to chat about your app design. I have read through the email thread between you and Tiffany, so I have somewhat of a grasp on what you are wanting to accomplish and have no doubt we can build it. Give me a call at your earliest convenience and we can go through what you had in mind in greater detail. From there we can go through what we do, and see if there might be a fit. My direct line is 720.366.4212. 

Thanks Matt, look forward to speaking with you.

Regards,

Taylor Grassby

	Debi, Aaron and Kathy:


I mentioned today that I will be helping a MICA grad student with an iPhone application which will be targeted towards 3rd - 5th grade students.  In short as I have mentioned the best way to describe the app is "geocaching" for trees with built in educational games to learn about the trees.  Anyway I will let Matt who I included in on this message reply to all and give a better idea of what he is looking for.  I think this would be a great opportunity to use technology with the kids while learning.

Matt,

It was a pleasure speaking with you this morning. I think your app is quite unique and could potentially be used by arboretums all over the world. I am in the process of putting all of my notes together and will meet with the developers tomorrow. I'm sure they will have some questions that I will need to defer to you. When I get out of that meeting I will reach out to you and we can work on getting a bid and a time frame together. 

Should you have any questions don't hesitate to reach out.

Have a great evening and I'll talk to you in a couple of days.

Taylor

Hey Matt,

What does your schedule look like today? I was wondering if you have a few minutes to chat about pricing for your app. Had a chance to go through everything with my team and everything is pretty straight forward.

Let me know and I can give you a call.

Thanks Matt, talk to you soon.

When I send it over are you available to chat? Let me know what your schedule looks like this afternoon.

Matt,

Sorry for the delay in getting you this. It is hard to get approval on things when the office is closed and I have to wait on emails...

	I’d be interested in helping you with this App for $0 in return experience.  I am currently working on an app for the Hippo which is due to be launched January 5th.  I have attached a resume.  My undergrad degree is in computer science so I have a programming background already I just haven’t developed many IPhone applications yet and am just starting out.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

	Hi David,
$0 is a deal that's too good to pass up, and I would love to have your help on the development.  I'm glad you're interested in the project.  I was rather vague in the craigslist ad, but I have a great plan for what I would like this app to do but am definitely open to hearing feedback or other ideas.  It is actually a really interesting project that should be  exceptional to have on a resume.    Considering my compressed timeline, though, and the fact that you're currently working toward your M.S., will you be able to keep up with the workload of school and the amount of focus needed for this app? Would it be wise to find ask a second developer to team up with you on this app?   I would really like to talk this app over with you so we can decide the best way to proceed.  Can you meet this weekend?
Thanks for your interest thus far!

	Hi David, meeting tomorrow evening works great for me and I am trying to get the rest of the team together for tomorrow night.  So far I haven't heard back from any of them.  The whole point of meeting in person is to introduce the team to each other.  Otherwise, I think that I can just have a phone/video conference with you as I'll be heading back to KY for the holidays immediately after our meeting.  If it turns out that you and I are the only two people who can meet tomorrow, I think we should just do skype or phone conversation so that I can hit the road ASAP.  What do you think?  I'll keep you posted about what the rest of the team says, but so far I haven't heard anything from them.

Also, I entered your # into my phone.  Is it better to communicate with you via email or text?

	Hi David,
I've heard back from at least one other person attached to the project, so let's go ahead and meet tomorrow evening.  How does 5 PM sound?  Do you have a preference for location?  I'm on board for coffee or a bar (first round on me), if either of those places sound good to you.  What part of town is convenient for you t o meet?  I live near the Hippo, so Mt. Vernon, Remington, or Station North is convenient for me but I have a car so I can get anywhere.  Let me know if that works for you.  Looking forward to meeting you!  See you tomorrow, David.
Best,
Matt

Full Text-
1 new Announcement: 
* Happy New Year to all!
We are happy to announce a stretch goal for StickNFind as well as an exciting new feature.
If we reach $600,000, we will have enough capital to build StickNFind in multiple Colors! We will produce StickNFind in 5 colors. Black, White, Red, Blue and Purple.
We need your help in spreading the word about StickNFind… A quick like on Facebook or emailing our website to a few friends helps a ton.
New Feature: We are happy to announce that each StickNFind has a built in thermometer, so, all users will be able to know the ambient temperature of a StickNFind. We were able to do this without increasing the material cost! It will be an added bonus to all!
How many times have you wondered what the temperature is in your room? Just check your StickNFind App.
Also, some other great news: Our design team members have just returned from China. Fully automated production of StickNFind has been successfully set up and tested! We are now awaiting final certifications, and mass production should start by the end of January (very soon).
You can check out some pictures of StickNFind production at: http://www.indiegogo.com/sticknfind?c=gallery
Please help us reach our $600,000 goal. Tell your friends, call your family, enlist your coworkers, tell your boss you need one for your favorite red stapler.
If we reach our $600,000 goal, you will be getting an email from us in February asking to pick a color for your StickNFind sticker order.
You can have them all in one color, or in a mixture.
Please do not email us about color selection. Wait for our email in February with more instructions.

I wanted to touch base and see where you stand with payment so we can get going.

Thanks Matt!

	H Taylor,
i am glad that Justin signed into the chat service. I put my card and for the payment service that you sent me, so everything should be good to go on that. However, I have a question because the invoice says the amount to be charged is about $2300 and I believe we had talked about making down payment and not the full payment all at once. How is that going to play out specifically?
At to you soon!

	Hi Nancy, I'm needing some clarification or guidance on what you think I should be doing for my portion of the thesis materials.  Let me explain,
I'm working with only ONE artist who will be producing generative art made through audience use of an app that is still in development.  As such, the actual work does not exist yet, and won't exist until the exhibition actually opens.  The work, being generative, will be produced through the synthesis of data sets through as-yet-unwritten algorithms.  

What I've done for Libby Zay is sent images of previous, but aesthetically and conceptually related work by this artist.  I can do that... but I don't want to misrepresent the work.  Furthermore, I only have concept scketches of what the app will look like- not screen shots- so I don't feel very comfortable showing a large set of them.  Maybe only the best ones?  Anyway, I did the best I could.

	Hi Matt,


These look good. You will be able to update the web images once the show opens so the website reflects the actual work. The print image is the only one you won't be able to exchange. Most of the artists from other programs don't have their actual thesis work done either so we tell them to do just what you did, send work that is representative of their larger body of work as an artist. 


Best,
Nancy

I'll get that all on the chatroom asap, as I realize that you're all still waiting on it.  Sorry for the delay.  It has taken longer than the one night of work that I expected.

Hey Matt,

Don't even worry about it, I had a suspicion something like that had happened. As for the deadline, we have plenty of time padded in (for reasons exactly like this). Believe me you are not the first client to have something get delayed on their end.

I have class tonight, but will check chatter in the morning and get back to you with any questions. 

Feel better, and I will talk to you tomorrow.

DS 1.99 Potential collaboration with Waldorf School
Date- 2/4/13 – 2/5/13
Recipient- Pat Alexander
Type- Email
Abstract-  This email is my attempt to get in contact with the Waldorf school.  I was hopeful that this would be a fruitful partnership, but it ended up with no fruits.  I tried to convince Mrs. Whitehead of the valure of this collaboration by explaining the app would investigate the very notions the Waldorf school was founded on.  I offered alternatives, like working with a small extra-curricular group of students.

	To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Matt Spalding and I am a graduate student at the Maryland Institute College of Art.  I am writing because I am developing my thesis exhibition project at Cylburn Arboretum.    One of the primary goals of my thesis is to make the various resources at the arboretum available to students for educational purposes.  I am working with Marianne Mears from Arts Education in Maryland Schools Alliance and Susan Patz to ensure that this app meets the high standards of k-12 education, however, I am equally as excited about the artistic features of this app as well.  I would like to explore the possibility of working with some teachers from The Waldorf school to begin to utilize this app as a teaching tool.  I realize that it is already late in the planning schedule for this semester, but I would like to see if there are ways that this app can overlap with some of your curriculum.  I am also interested in working with extra-curricular and after-school programs that deal with science and the arts.  Do you have time to meet next week with myself and the education coordinator from Cylburn Arboretum Association?  The development of this project is still young, so I would like to make the app as responsive to your teacher's and student's needs as possible.  Please let me know and thank you in advance for your time.

	Hi Pat!
Thanks for getting back in touch with me so quickly! It's a smart-phone based app. It is designed to work specifically with iphone 4 and above, because it uses lots of hardware not included in earlier models. Not everyone has access to this equipment, so users can check out phones from the front desk for free.

	Dear Matt
Please give me a call when you have a minute – might be easier to get an accurate idea of what you are doing over the phone! As a Pre-K to 8 Waldorf school we do not use technology in the classroom, which may mean we are not the school you are searching for!
 
I have attached an article that will help explain our approach.
 
best wishes

	Hi Pat, 
I left a message on your machine... though it may have been a bit rambling.  Just to reiterate, I am extremely interested in working with the Waldorf school on this project because your philosophy toward tech is so contrary to what many educators believe.  As I said in my message to you, my main goal is to check if technology works to supplement the experience of nature, or if it impedes the experience.  It's a very difficult question to ascertain, and I am trying to figure out the best way to ascertain this information, either from the use of empirical data gathering or through more open-ended questioning of users.  

Either way, there are other aspects of this app that I think the Waldorf school can help with.  If possible, can Susan Patz and I sit down with you to discuss these ideas? I know that your time is valuable, but I think that this app can go a long way to help the Waldorf school come to a deeper understanding of its own philosophy toward learning.  Even if it's just with a small extra-curricular group organized around testing out these theories toward learning.

Hi Ms. Cornish,
I'm not sure if you have seen my previous emails, but in case you haven't, I'll give a brief introduction of myself:
My name is Matt Spalding and I am a graduate student at the Maryland Institute College of Art.  I am writing because I am developing my thesis project at Cylburn Arboretum, which will open Cylburn Arboretum up as an educational resource.  To achieve this goal I am creating an app for use at the arboretum that, with the help of Arts Education in  Mayland Schools Alliance, meets several Core Curriculum indicator standards in environmental science, math, and reading.  I am providing all of the necessary hardware for the teachers and students to experience this app, so there is no cost to the school.

My project has lessons to achieve CC indicator standards:

CCSS 1.1
CCSS 1.2
CCSS 1.4

CCSS 2.1
CCSS 2.2 
CCSS 2.3
CCSS 2.4

CCSS 6.2
CCSS 6.3

These are merely baseline goals for the app to achieve and I would love collaborate with yourself and teachers who instruct grades 3-5 at your school to work in other indicator standards you may see as necessary.

I would like the opportunity to sit down with you to discuss the possibility of working with the teachers who instruct grades 3-5 at your school.  I know you are very busy, especially considering the upcoming holiday season, but please let me know if you have time to meet either in person or over the phone to discuss this project.

Thanks again and I'm looking forward to hearing from you,
Matt Spalding

I'm not sure if you saw my email from yesterday, or my previous attempts to get in touch with you, but I would like to emphasize how interested I am in getting in touch with you to work with the teachers of your 3rd-5th grade students.  I have a detailed plan for engaging the students and would really appreciate the opportunity to present this plan to you.  Please let me know that you have received this email, and let me know if you have any time before the end of the fall term for me to come in and explain my plan for you.  Thanks again.  Looking forward to hearing from you.

Abstract- This email was an update (duh) to Susan about the progress of the app.  I asked for several things in this email:
1. Audio scripts of their existing cell phone tour
2. Help getting in touch with Waldorf school, since MLK fell through
3. scheduling a Monday visit to Cylburn with Jeremy (Graphic design mentor)
4. scheduling a progress update on Feb 11th
Susan also offered her help in approaching whichever new school I talk to in order to help translate the “school-ese”

	Hi Susan, 
I hope your year is going well so far.  I am working steadily on my thesis, but I need to fill in lots of content on the app.  The app will be completed and submitted to the itunes store on march 22.  I would really like to get a couple things to help complete the app-
   1. I would really like to get the scripts for your audio tours to pull some content
   2. I would really like to get in contact with the Walden School, if you can set up a virtual introduction, I would really like to begin talks with them as soon as possible.  I understand that procrastination on my part doesn't constitute an emergency on your part, and while this is not an emergency, I would really like to spend as much time as possible working with this school before the app is launched on Apr. 19th.  The more rich my experience working with the school is, the better this app will be.  I hope this email didn't put you in panic mode. That's not fair to do to you.
   3. If possible, we talked about coming on a Monday with my exhibition design mentor for a couple hours.  Is this still possible?  We are shooting for Feb. 11th.
   4. I would also like to meet with you and Lily on the 11th for a progress check-in.  Does that day work for you?  What time is good?  We typically meet in the afternoons, so how does 3:30 sound?
Thanks so much!  I hope to hear from you soon.

3 and 4 -Sorry I cannot do the 11th.  Does the 12th work for you?  Lili does this work for you as well?  
AND I would like to set up a meeting with our city chief- to hear a similar summary of your thesis work so she is informed too.


2--I will contact the Waldorf School to see if I can connect you with the right teacher and classroom. But this is not a typical time frame when working with classrooms. It takes pre-planning and lead time because teachers plan and allocate time on a yearlong or semester basis.  I hope there is a teacher who can work with your time frame. I recommend a "real time" meeting with that teacher, vs. virtual and I will be happy to join you as the Cylburn partner and to help you talk "school-ese."  I will let you know as soon as I get a response from Waldorf. 


1--In sharing the cell tour scripts with you, they should be used as a research tool (i.e., reference material for your thesis work), but the scripts are not to be used in any other fashion.  Do not publish, or share beyond your project work.  Cylburn has not decided what proprietary use to assign the scripts yet. 


Hope your work, technical and content-driven is going well.

	Hi Susan,
I would be more than happy to present my project to your city chief.  I have spent the last month finishing the script for the development team and have put it into a very step-by-step, easy to understand word document.  I wouldn't mind coming in any other time to make the presentation. Just let me know what works best with your schedules for that, and I'll be sure to to be there.

On the subject of meetings, I can see if some things can get moved around.  Do you have a particular time that works on the 12th?  Usually 3:30 or 4, right?

Thanks for connecting me with the Waldorf school contact you have.  I think I shot myself in the foot for going after only MLK school, and then not jumping back on this before the Waldorf school started back.  If I can't get into the classroom to work, I would also be happy working with an extracurricular club, or an after school program.  I'm pretty flexible on this part.  Please let me know if you have any luck and feel free to pass along my contact info or connect me to this person over email.  Thanks again.

Which brings me all the way back- full circle- to talking about meetings some more.  Thanks for offering to sit in with me at the school.  I think that your fluency with "school-ese" would be a big help.  It's a world that I don't fully understand, and I could really use your expertise.  

I'll talk to you again soon. Let me know when you'd like me to present to the city chief.

DS 1.104 Meeting tomorrow
Date- 2/1/13- 2/8/13
Recipient- 
from:
	 Justin Livi <silaslivi@gmail.com> 
	to:
	 Matthew Spalding <mspalding@mica.edu>
	

Type- Email
Abstract- This email chain appears to be started by Justin Livi to me without prompting. However, I recollect sending him either a text message or an email that told him about this upcoming meeting.  I don’t have any evidence of this exchange, so there’s no way to be sure.  My emails with him take a significant break from December 28- April 8.  Also, at the end of this email there is no confirmation of a meeting time or place.  It leaves off with a lingering question about whether or not we would be “Meeting at Doris at 3”.  I suspect that we concluded communication on this topic through text message, as it was our preferred method of communication, but I can’t be sure.  I know that the next email to myself on Feb 8th was an email in preparation for our meeting at a Starbucks near his house.


The title of the email chain, though (Meeting tomorrow) leads me to suspect that I started this communication, because I think it would be highly unusual for Justin to tell me he’s off the project in an email that has the subject line “meeting tomorrow”.  I spend the majority of this email chain convincing him to stay on the project, and elaborating on how much I have already invested in promoting him on this project.

	Hey Matt haven't heard from you in awhile,


Hey so I've been thinking recently, and I've realized that with my own thesis I have a lot on my plate. I've also realized that the project direction has veered significantly from what I had expected it to be and that my role in the project has also changed and works less for what I'm looking for in my portfolio.


I think unfortunately my time will be best served working on my own thesis and bringing it to the highest level of polish possible. I'm sorry I didn't contact you earlier about this but I only just began thinking about this after our last meeting. I hope that it's not too difficult for you to continue the project without me, but you have the developer company which will hopefully be able to pick the slack.


Thanks for the offer and your time and best of luck,

	Hi Justin,

I am sorry to receive this letter from you at this point in the semester, and was surprised at some of the issues that were raised.  I wonder how long you have been feeling this way, and I wish that we would have communicated better about these feelings over the break.  After reading your note, however,I am left with a few  questions about what lead to this decision.  As a way to amend some of our communication issues, I wonder if you wouldn't mind answering a couple of lingering issues for me.  Remember, this experience is just as much of a learning process for me as it is for you.  I would like to sit down with you and ask these questions, if you're available for coffee, because i think the answers to these questions would be too much to write in an email.   

If you truly feel that you cannot continue with this project, I understand, especially considering this is your Thesis semester, and Thesis is very important.  To that end, I have considered your letter and wish that you would reconsider your decision.  There have already been tremendous resources poured into this project.  
   * MICA is printing postcards of your work which will be distributed all across Baltimore as part of their effort for promotion during the American Alliance of Museums.  This will be the first time the AAM conference will be held in Baltimore in 20 years.  MICA is bringing many curators, directors, and collectors from all of the country to visit the Curatorial Practice exhibition sites.  
   * I have paid %60 percent of the  cost of production for the app, which is a significant portion of my budget.  I have also ensured, as you can see from the guidelines for the contract that I forwarded and you gave me approval on, that you have full access to whatever data you need to make your artwork
   * The work that we were going to exhibit, as I recall was based on preexisting algorithms that you have already written. Your works, "Community()" and "Ancient_Beasts", which as I understand are two different iterations of an essentially similar concept.  While I know that you are busy with your Thesis, I don't see that this will be too hard for you to accomplish with what resources you have at your disposal.  

Honestly, I was most excited about your part in this project.  You  make excellent Fine Art, and I feel that this Thesis needs contemporary artwork like yours.  If the above reasons don't persuade you to finish this project with me, I would still appreciate the opportunity to sit down with you to ask other questions.  Like I said, I need to learn how and why this went off the rails and what I can do in the future to prevent this from happening again.

Give me a call, shoot me a text, or email me soon, please.

Best, 
Matt Spalding

	Hey Matt,


I guess perhaps I was hasty and rather dramatic with my last email. However I've grown increasingly uncomfortable about my investment in the project as I don't feel I've ever really gotten a clear picture of what exactly the project's scope is. The closest I felt we came to really nailing it down was at our last meeting before we had a developer, where I felt increasingly that my role in the project was becoming tangential. At our last meeting it seemed like there were two separate parts to the application, rather than it being a unified whole and that aesthetically my contribution would appear to be a sort of bizarre afterthought or addition, which most users wouldn't even see, experience, or comprehend. I think we talked about this issue at the meeting and though my concerns at the time were eased, they recently rose again.


I think my main feeling right now is confusion as to how exactly the project will shape up and an uneasiness, as I feel the entire process up to this point has been somewhat rocky and a bit directionless. I may be completely wrong about this, maybe it's just a difference in approach, and perhaps you were about to allay my concerns at the meeting. But for a project of this size, I had expected things to be moving much earlier and more quickly and since I hadn't heard from you or received a schedule or timeline, I had actually misinterpreted your silence as the project not happening, or not needing me any longer. This was probably really unfair as it was only about a month of no communication, and I also didn't make any attempts to contact you, but it was in this silence that I became increasingly uneasy and in addition I tried to access the salesforce chatter thing without any success after the first use.


If my role is integral to the success of the project I'm willing to continue as I realize my notice is unfairly last-minute and I made an agreement and I am still invested in the ideas and original goals of the project. I'm sorry that I came off so harsh, sudden and dramatic, but I'm not very good at confrontation and I haven't really known how best to approach this. Sorry I'm still trying to figure this whole professional-ish freelance thing out, as my past experiences have been overwhelmingly negative and I'm overly cautious of entering into another similar experience, and I might have wrongly interpreted things as warning signs.

	I can understand your hesitation.  I really can.  There were lots of breakdowns for me at the end of 2012, and I spent a lot of time getting my head back on straight.  Regardless, things are progressing on schedule for this project.  I have met deadlines on this project and am excited to move forward with you as the figure in the spotlight.  However, I feel we need to address a few lingering issues, and I do still have a list of questions I'd like to ask you so I can learn a little bit more about where this went off the rails.  

I think that we should meet this week.  I want to make sure that your needs are met in this process as well.  I don't like that you feel "tacked-on" to this project, and would like to find better ways of ensuring that your work is as highlighted as possible.  I think that the best course of action to move this process forward, and so everyone is heard and on the same page, is that we should have a brainstorming session with my program director George Ciscle and James Rouvelle.  I have Cc'd them here so we can work something out together.  I'd like to give you as much direction as you need, but I'm afraid that I am a terrible communicator when it comes to things like that so this meeting should help us come to a more clear understanding.  

When can you meet?  Wednesday or Friday work best for me.

	Hi Justin,
I am about to meet with the SEED school about the project, and I am going to forward the proposal to them.  However, before I do so, I want to ensure that we are on the same page creatively with this project.  Please get in touch with me about meeting up so I can ensure that you get what you need out of this process.  I am hoping to send the updated plan on Sunday.  

Let me know when you're free.

I'm wondering if you got the chance to take a look at a few schedules to help us coordinate to come together do discuss the collaboration between SEED school and Cylburn Arboretum.  Please email me back when you can to help coordinate when this meeting can happen.  I know Susan Patz and Dr. Kirkland are anxious to get started on this plan, as am I.  Thanks again and I look forward to hearing back from you.

	I understand you're a gal who knows how to get things.  We had talked before about how simple it would be to get the phones needed for my exhibition, but I've followed a couple leads to no avail.  I currently am writing a grant application to the Verizon Foundation, but it's a beast... and I'm applying to a foundation, so there are all sorts of problems with timing...

I'm in need of your tenacity.  Even if just for 30 minutes to help me think in the right direction.

	Ah yes, I've done a couple of those, though they're usually pretty specific. They're not necessarily generative, though they could be interesting to consider. I have some ideas which would examine the intersection of atomism and taoism in relation to ecology and the nature of a community. It would consider the role of an individual as a discrete unit, and then as defined or actualized as a part of a larger whole. Basically the one vs. the many, but more elegant. I haven't quite figured out how the source data would fit into this yet or what exactly the specific program would be, but I have some ideas for emergent systems and ways of displaying them.

	I'll get Justin  to talk to the 3 of us ASAP.  I'm going to write him an email and I'll Bcc you on that.  I'd rather not immediately start by threatening to involve James Rouvelle, but I understand that if you feel like you need to involve him that is your prerogative.  

I've attached the agreement that Justin and I looked over on Saturday.  I'll bring in the notes we made for you to look at tomorrow.  I'm also going to forward all of the correspondence that we've had over email since last week.

I can understand why you are worried about this project and why you assumed the worst when Justin wasn't there today.  I admit it looked bad, and I don't have any idea why he wasn't there other than "he must have forgotten".  However, I want to stress that I have worked hard in two areas lately, and while you don't see it now, I ask that you give me the benefit of the doubt so I can show you.

Melissa Grim is Cylburn's City Chief.  She gives the final OK for all at Cylburn.


Please note comments in red below, especially as it pertains to your display design.  During major events/weddings etc (rental of Vollmer Bldg.) the city will most likely move your display into an office. But in terms of potential theft???  Maybe you are able to secure the iPads similar to the apple store or some other way to make them secure. Would be a good idea.


When you and Lili decide to schedule another meeting, we can invite Melissa to attend.


Call if you have any questions re: anything.

Subject: UPDATE: MICA at Cylburn
 
Hello Melissa
 
I want to continue to keep you informed about this project. Lili and I met with Matt and his faculty advisor, George Ciscle, yesterday to learn the finalized details of his project.  
 
One change to original project- the middle school class he will be working with has changed from the Waldorf School, to the SEED School of Baltimore.
 
Logistics coming up:
1---Matt is guiding this class (approx. ~25 students+ ~3 chaperones) 3 times to Cylburn this spring.  He will notify Lili ASAP so that we can coordinate those field trip dates with your calendar.  
Yep, this is great. I like to have these on the calendar so we plan accordingly.
 
2-- Matt shared his design concept for the curatorial project yesterday as well.  During his cell tour app at the Arboretum he has drawn and will build a small stand (3ft. X 3ft.)  that will hold 7 iPads to display the results of the phone app the middle school students create.  This will be a dynamic display that changes as more cell app statistics are incorporated into the iPad designs. He is aware that this must be a platform display similar to the Bird Display- on wheels and easy to roll out of the way.  If 2 display cases seem congested in the Vollmer, we can remove the birds, but I hope that is not necessary.  He would like to show you this design.
I think the portable stand sounds good.  I don’t think that most of the time it will be too much to have both displays in the lobby…it’s a big lobby.   But as you know, I really appreciate the wheels.
I would like to see the design. It would be smart if one dimension of the platform was 24” maximum so that it would roll comfortably through doorways. 36” platform will not go through a 36” door and we might have to store this in a closet or office during a wedding.
 I am thinking about  security too, so I want to make sure we are minimizing the temptation for theft, either during the open hours or a temptation for break in.  I am not really worried but I want to be thoughtful in our approach.
 
3-- Self-contained in this display "platform" will be brochures to let visitors know about the project and how it works.  He will send us the content of the brochure for review and approval.
Great.

	Thank you so much for checking with Melissa Grim about the Vollmer.  I will adjust the design to fit her suggestions to make the width small enough to fit through a 36" door.  I also have been thinking about how to secure the tablets to the stand.  I will have something installed, but I'm not sure what the solution to that problem is yet.  

Lili and I haven't officially scheduled another meeting together, but I was hoping to see her on Friday.  I wrote an email to that effect, so I'll send a second one tomorrow to her.  Do you think Melissa should come to that (as yet unconfirmed) meeting on Friday?  I would love to get her input.  

Thanks again Susan!

George brought up at the meeting that we should meet weekly.  I think that's a really great idea.  I have open time on Fridays every week.  Do you have the same availability every week?  If so we can set something up regularly. Thanks for all you contribute to this process.  I look forward to our weekly visits together.  Let me know what works best for you!

	Sorry Matt, I was in meetings all day yesterday. Fridays are fine to meet. Can we say 1pm? I have recurring meetings on Friday mornings. Has enough changed since Tuesday that you want to meet this week?
 
I would suggest that you have a few more of your unanswered questions answered before meeting with Melissa. She really isn’t someone that we should meet with continuously, only someone to touch base with and get approval. If she has a bad feeling about something she can cause a huge roadblock and it will be hard to change her mind. Additionally, it is hard to get on her calendar on such short notice. Maybe we should plan to meet with her once we have actually met with the SEED school people.
 
Let me know if you feel that a meeting tomorrow is necessary, otherwise I’d rather wait until next week so you have at least a week to make some headway on your project.
 
Lili

	Hi Lili,
Friday at 1 works great for me.  I think you're right that there's really no reason to meet this week.  I was only hoping to do a little pre-planning with you about what kinds of things we want to figure out in our meeting with Justin and Jallon from the SEED school.  I was hoping to be as prepared as possible before we met with them in regard to your list of needs and wants from this partnership.  By the way, have you checked out the Doodle I sent to schedule that meeting? 

Anyway, Lets go ahead and meet next Friday (hopefully we'll have met with Jallon and Justin by then) when I have the final design of my exhibit stand ready for Melissa to review.  

Thanks!
Matt

	Okay. Sudan talked about the city chief at Cylburn, but never have s name for that person. Makes sense that it's Melissa.
What duo you think of planning a meeting with her for march 1? That way you and Susan can get drafts of the materials before she sees them and we should be able to kick out back and forth a little bit for revision.
I've almost got the flier script finished. I also have a script for the 24"x36" poster that's nearly finished.I'm going to get those to you and Sue tomorrow.
Thanks !

Type- Email
Abstract- This email was sent, as far as I’m aware, unsolicited from Susan Patz.  However, I doubt that is the cast.  This conjecture is entirely unsupported, but her email was probably initiated in response to a concern voiced by George or Lili.   I had that thought initially when I saw this email, but strayed away from it because motivations seemed a secondary concern, I believe in retrospect.

	Hi Lili,
George brought up at the meeting that we should meet weekly.  I think that's a really great idea.  I have open time on Fridays every week.  Do you have the same availability every week?  If so we can set something up regularly. Thanks for all you contribute to this process.  I look forward to our weekly visits together.  Let me know what works best for you!

	Sorry Matt, I was in meetings all day yesterday. Fridays are fine to meet. Can we say 1pm? I have recurring meetings on Friday mornings. Has enough changed since Tuesday that you want to meet this week?
 
I would suggest that you have a few more of your unanswered questions answered before meeting with Melissa. She really isn’t someone that we should meet with continuously, only someone to touch base with and get approval. If she has a bad feeling about something she can cause a huge roadblock and it will be hard to change her mind. Additionally, it is hard to get on her calendar on such short notice. Maybe we should plan to meet with her once we have actually met with the SEED school people.
 
Let me know if you feel that a meeting tomorrow is necessary, otherwise I’d rather wait until next week so you have at least a week to make some headway on your project.
 
Lili

	Hello Dr. Kirkland.
This is an introductory email with names and addresses for all of us to share.

It was a pleasure reconnecting with Julia, and though we are sorry to miss utilizing Cylburn's neighboring school, TWSB for this interesting opportunity, we are excited to coordinate with The SEED School.  Matt Spalding is the creator and curator of the iPhone Tour at Cylburn, and will be emailing you and will take the lead in arranging a meeting with Mr. Eames, and the two of us. He may also include others as he feels appropriate. He will introduce his project to you and we will see where this leads.  I am aware you received my brief summary of Matt's project below, but this meeting will give you the chance to learn in detail what the school/park experience will be.  Matt will be able to answer your questions related to the app. or expectations of students' performance while at Cylburn. We will ask for your feedback as well.

So thank you in advance for your interest in this unusual (and I think wonderful) experiential learning opportunity.  I'm looking forward to meeting you.

Subject: Connecting from Cylburn

Hello Julia and Ed.

A year or two ago, Nancy Hill (Cylburn Education Director) and I
(Cylburn Arboretum Association Board member) met with you to discuss
potential Waldorf School/Cylburn Arboretum connections.

A new opportunity for this spring has arisen. A graduate student in
MICA's Curatorial Practice Masters of Arts program is creating a digital
tour at Cylburn and would like to work with one or two middle school
classrooms.  His project is based on iPhones that he will loan to
students while at Cylburn- that guide them to 4 to 6 sites around the
arboretum utilizing the cell tour and other info he includes on the
iPhone app. His project involves the design and development of the phone
app and the supervision of school visits. He would like to work with one
or two middle school  classrooms.

The underlying goal of his work is to measure whether digital technology
aids in exploring nature or is a deterrent. For students, it will be a
lot of fun and the tour will be similar to orienteering with nature
inspired themes.

If you could, please let me know if there may be a teacher (s) who may
be interested in this project. Time frame would be April 19 through May.
I am not sure if the project requires 1 or 2 field trip experiences at
Cylburn.  If you are interested, I can arrange to have Matt Spalding,
Masters student, speak with you and faculty members to learn more about
his proposed project.  We will work with the graduate student as well to
assure a quality experience on the Cylburn grounds. I know this is a
late request for school year planning calendars,  but I volunteered to
help this student reach out to neighboring schools, and TWSB of course
came to mind first.

Please contact me either way, email or cell.
Thanks.
Sue Patz

Let me begin by letting you know that I am very much excited about the opportunity for SEED to be able to partner with Cylburn. As a new resident of Baltimore, I was in awe of your facilities when I was able to visit this summer. The SEED School of Maryland is the only public boarding school in the state of Maryland serving close to 400 students in grades 6-10 and will eventually serve grades 6-12.  Our singular mission is that all of our students will go on to graduate college!
I have copied both our Director of Academics, Jallon Croskey and Justin Eames, our technology teacher who should be included on future correspondence as Justin will lead this project for SEED.
Finally I have copied JoAnn Robinson who can help get coordinate our calendars in order to meet face to face. Here's to a long lasting partnership.

	I'm excited to meet with everyone to discuss this collaboration.  I can't wait to explore all the ways this app can help forward the collaboration between the SEED school and Cylburn Arboretum.  

I am excited to discuss with you all in further detail how the resources from both of these sites can be used to the fullest extent through this app.  Therefore, I will be forwarding my proposal this weekend after I finalize a few updates.  I will send this updated proposal first for you all to review and then we should meet so I can give a quick presentation and we can plan how to proceed.  

Dr. Kirkland, thank you for your excitement over this collaboration.  Also thank your for gathering all parties from your school who should be involved.  You have been an amazing help to this process.

Justin and Jallon, I look forward to meeting you both. Thank you for your involvement in the project.  We should get together many times in the near future to get to the details of how this app should best function.  I can start a Google Calendar or a Doodle so we can plan out a schedule.
  

I will get in touch with JoAnn Robinson to coordinate schedules.
I'm excited to work with you all in the coming months.  Thank you all for your time!

Looks quite ambitious. But this is the clearest pieces we have seen to date. You were a bit sloppy and have MLK school in there several times when you most likely mean SEED.  Many details to work out. Look forward to your answers tomorrow.

	Hi Dr. Kirkland and the rest of the team from the SEED school,
I would like to thank you all again for your continued interest in this project.  I have worked out with Ms. Joann Robinson the date and time for our upcoming meeting surrounding this endeavor.  It is scheduled for Feb. 25th at 9 am.  Susan, Lili, and I can't wait to talk this all out with you.

I have also been in contact with Justin and Jallon from the SEED school to coordinate a pre-meeting planning session so that we can all be on the same page and can move forward with purpose at our meeting on the 25th.  

Thank you all again for your support and interest. I look forward to meeting you all soon.

Abstract- This email was in response to Justin Livi missing a thesis review committee meeting because of an apparent miscommunication.  I sent this email because George was unsure of Justin’s involvement in the project.  To reassure him, I tried to schedule a meeting between the three of us to get us all on the same page.

	Hi Justin,
I'm wondering what happened today and why you weren't at the meeting with Cylburn?  I told George, my program director, that you would be there and that we had worked out all of the issues that were holding up this project from before.  Did you forget about the meeting?  Are we still on the same page?  My program director is worried that I haven't worked through this plan with you and that your key contribution to this project will not happen and thereofore this project will fail.  He needs some reassurance that we are clear about this project and we are moving forward with clarity and purpose.  For my sake, are you able to come in to meet with the two of us?  He really needs reassurance that we have a plan, which I finalized and sent to you after our meeting on Friday.  George would really like to ensure that you have seen the plan going forward and that what we have discussed is still the plan.  Please let me know when you can meet so that George's concerns can be put to rest.  

Matt

	Ah Matt I'm sorry I wasn't at the meeting. When was it? I guess I was confused because I thought we had decided I didn't need to come? Or were there two different meetings? I didn't see it on the schedule either. I am definitely committed, sorry to frighten you. I did get the docs, and they look good. I can come in and meet with the two of you. Would tomorrow around 2 or 3 work?

Also, thanks for coming to see me and my program director.  I'll have to wait let you know what time will work best until I hear back from him about his schedule.  Thanks again.

	I have night classes Monday and Wednesday, this Thursday is Valentine's day and I'm out of town Friday through Sunday for IndieCade. I'm technically free early in the morning Monday and Wednesday, but I don't want to drive into the city then because my classes aren't until later and I do most of my work very late at night - translates into no work getting done at school because I'm dead tired and can't concentrate. The best times for me are between noon and 4 pm Tuesday through Thursday

	Okay, well lets try to figure out a time on Thursday.  I realize that this is Valentine's day and may conflict with some people's plans, but it is important to meet to discuss these issues.  If everyone can meet tomorrow at some point during the day, I would feel a lot better.  Thanks everyone.  We'll get this figured out.

Type- Email
Abstract- This email chain was started to get a discussion going about the finer points of the partnership, including which age ranges would be involved in the project and what days the SEED school would be available to do field trips.  I made the mistake in this email of saying I’d like to work with high school students, but also corrected myself to say that I’d work with middle school students, like initially discussed.

	Hello again,
There are a few questions about scheduling and numbers that the city needs to get as soon as possible.  I would like to have the students out to Cylburn to see the facilities and meet with a Master Naturalist.  I would also like to get the group back to Cylburn to a second time to look at the gardens with the help of a Master Gardener to plan a component of the programming.  We have to make reservations with the city and compare calendars.  I'd like to get the class(es) associated with this project out to Cylburn 3 times through the end of the semester.  I think, therefore, that we should work with a small test-group of one class to test this procedure and manage the experience.

My specific logistics that must be discussed are:
      1. How many students will be working on this project.  Again, I think this should be a pilot group of one class.  Preferably, I would like to work with your 9th and 10th graders, if possible.  Cylburn needs to know how many students to expect and how many chaperones 
      2. Which dates are available for field trips with a class?   Please check your schedule for possible dates that will work.  Cylburn is looking for 5 possible days to get some flexibility.  The timeline that I would like to work with are: once in March, Once in April (After the exhibition opens on April 19th), and Once in early May.  We will need to discuss in further detail the goals of each of these visits, but it is important to the city, and I'm sure your own calendars, to get these dates locked in early. 


Thank you all again for your continued support,
Matt Spalding

	Hey Matt,

In terms of these two questions:

1.) The initial information that was forwarded to me by Dr. Kirkland indicated that you were looking for 1-2 middle school classes so that's what I've been planning on (two).  I could knock it down to a single class, but I would have to rethink some things if it's high school students which are needed.  How important is that?
2.) I'm going to the questions of dates for Jallon or someone else in the administration.  I'm completely flexible about when we go, but they'll have some requirements to make sure we don't plan anything during important testing/events.  They can speak much better to those dates.

I've just responded again to the Doodle.  Let me know if any of the times works for you.

Thanks,
Justin Eames

	Hi Matt
Are you able to do Middle School like you initially discussed. and prior to that it was MLK jr. elementary.  Why high school now?  But if you have already worked with Justin a bit on logistics, stick with what you have decided. There is also not much difference between working with one or two classes once you have your classes in place.  So maybe you can give and take a little with Justin.
Thanks

	Hi Justin and Susan,
I'm sorry for the mistake about high school vs middle school students working on this project.  It was not clear to me that was already determined by us.  I'll make a note of that.  One or two middle school classes is perfect, and I'm glad to hear that you have already been planning for two classes.  Thank you!

As far as scheduling, I can get in touch with Jallon Croskey and Joann Robinson to get that all sorted out.  I believe testing is through most of March, is that correct?

	Hi Sue,
Sorry, I must have somehow gotten that all confused in my head.  Yes, I have been planning from the beginning to work with middle school students.  I mistakenly assumed that I would be working with the high school students because the first 2 years are remedial education, and I thought that I would be working with the high school students would have more flexibility in their curriculum's pedagogy.  I was frankly, stressing out a little bit thinking that I would have to tweak my plans to fit better with the capabilities of high school students.  It's cleared up for me now, though.  Sorry to worry you.

Thanks!
Matt

	Hi everyone, 
It looks like Thursday @ 10 AM is the best time to have this meeting.  Where should we meet?  Because it's in the middle of the school day, should we go to the SEED school?
For those whose schedules prohibit them from attending, I will take minutes of this meeting and will keep you in the loop.  Let me know if any problems come up with this plan.

Thanks for your help!

	In the attached document are some of my thoughts on the scripts. 
 
Overall, I think you need to be careful with how much “artspeak” you’re using. It is easy when you are surrounded by visual and artistic thinkers to develop a language that you all can communicate with, but when you are trying to communicate with the general public the language can be a barrier between you and them. Here are a couple of examples:
 
artfully interactive experience

You are totally right.  I don't even realize that I'm speaking in jargon most of the time, and my goal is definitely to speak to a broader audience.  Thanks for the notes.  I'll revise and resend in a few days along with a few new documents.

	Hello again,
Justin Eames is coordinating with me to get some dates together for two classes to visit Cylburn Arboretum.  Ideally, I would like to find 3-5 dates that could work for this purpose so that we can all be flexible when coordinating schedules.  
I believe testing is in March, is that correct?  What dates are available for us to work around testing?

Thank you,

	Hi Matt,
 
I may be able to attend the meeting Thursday for a few minutes.  If not, I can still offer some potential dates.  I will need to know if we are focusing on middle or high school students in order to determine this.  Our state testing for most of  middle school does end March, and testing for high school continues through May.  We should be able to work around this depending on the group we select to work with.
 
Thanks,
 
Jallon

	Hi lili, 
Thanks for making time for this meeting.  Because it's in the middle of the day, Justin Eames will have to meet at the school Is that a problem for your schedule?

	Matt,
 
I was planning on attending the meeting at SEED. 
I do need to be back to Cylburn around 11am because a new employee is coming in for a few hours of training that day. I was also realizing that Monday is a bad day for me to be away from Cylburn because it is the new employee’s first day. If I’m not at Cylburn, she is going to be completely by herself. I checked with Sue and she is still on board for that meeting and will let me know what happens.
 
I’m still thinking about Master Naturalists. What role are they going to serve? Can you tell me a little more about that, I would be able to link you up with someone who fits the bill.
 
Any idea on where we are meeting at SEED? Like go to the front office?
 
Lili

	Okay, I can totally understand why you can't be at the meeting on Monday.  I'm glad that you're able to attend the meeting tomorrow as this is more of the planning session anyway, I believe.  

I'm not sure where to meet tomorrow.  I assume we should meet at the front desk, but I sent Justin E an email just to make sure.  

Also, we can talk about whether a master naturalist will be useful or not tomorrow.

Type- Email
Abstract- This email asked Justin Eames about my “stretch goals” for the project, which were in reality, back-up in case the generative artwork didn’t come through.  I also wanted to see if I could create a more lasting bond with Cylburn through the possibility of having an exhibition at a later date at Cylburn as the result of the SEED student’s efforts.  I also attached the most up-to-date proposal.

	Hi Justin, 
Thanks again for meeting with me today.  I'm glad that we got to touch base about a few things in preparation for our meeting on Monday with the wider SEED school.  I've attached the proposal here in order for you to look it over and ensure that we are all on the same page.  I'm going to look at it once more myself, just in case I've made an error in my latest revisions, but I think everything should be clear.  

I would really like to understand what your General Learning Outcomes and Objectives are for the classes that I'll be working with, and how my project fits into that framework.  it's important for me to understand these goals so that I can better address the needs of the students.  A brief, generalized, and bulleted will do nicely.  Thank you in advance!

I wanted to ask also if your class has the ability to do some programming language translation.  I'm not sure what your students are capable of, but here's my dilemma-
My artist on the project, Justin Livi is producing what is called "generative artwork" by looking at data sets that are gathered by the use of this app.  In his words, he is working with "ideas which would examine the intersection of atomism and taoism in relation to ecology and the nature of a community. It would consider the role of an individual as a discrete unit, and then as defined or actualized as a part of a larger whole. Basically the one vs. the many, but more elegant. I haven't quite figured out how the source data would fit into this yet or what exactly the specific program would be, but I have some ideas for emergent systems and ways of displaying them."

Essentially, I am wondering 2 things, and I consider these "stretch goals" for my project.  I realize the difficulty of what I am asking, but I am not sure the capabilities of your students, and all of this goes way over my head, so I don't think it will hurt to ask.
      1. Will your students be able to somehow convert Justin's work, which runs on Java into the language the developers of the app are using?
      2. Failing this language conversion would your students be able to conduct some sort of data visualization of the data collected by the app?
Thanks again for your excitement.  I look forward to developing activities and working with our classes on March 14th.  See you Monday!

	Hey Matt,

In regards to this class, it is a totally open elective.  I run what's usually referred to as a flipped classroom.  That means students have access to loads of instructinal videos I've made.  The fun part of that is that students can choose their own adventure, so to speak.  If a student has an interest in graphic design, they do that.  If a student has an interest in educational gaming, they do that.  As a result, there aren't really any measurable objectives beyond having a good time while learning about some aspect of technology.  That being said, there's no problem with me working on any content you think would be beneficial.  Does that make sense?

In regards to the second part, I think students working with Java directly would be too much.  One of the classes has a little experience with some extremely light coding, using Logo and a language called Alice (www.alice.org), but nothing that would be of much use for this project.  In terms of visualizing the data, I think that would be doable.  Could you say more about what you had in mind?  PowerPoints, Infographics, Graphs, all of the above?

	Hey Matt,


So it's the 28th, and as promised I have some sketches of the proposed programs. I'm still not sure what data we're gonna have so I set up a relational system which can easily be modified and stretched to suit our conceptual needs. I made this little video just showing some of the different variations. They're all pretty similar in appearance right now, but I'm working on a few more very different-looking variations. 


We also have the option of user interaction/input as I built it in there just for my personal testing purposes, but it might be nice. I still need to do a lot of work on optimizing the performance (as you can probably see the frame rate is really low) but hopefully this is a good enough starting point. 


Let me know if you have any critiques or concerns,


Thanks!

hey Justin, I don't want to leave you hanging on this- I checked out the video that you sent me and I love it looks like. it's really great to see video of your heart instead of just still pictures. it's really incredible to see how she's different nodes interact for my break apart.  
when I was watching the video I saw that end in a couple times and that the frame scrolled around to be able to view different parts of the generation.  is that something that the user will be able to interact with and play with?
also, the meeting with a SEED school an exceptionally well.  I've drafted up a survey for the students to look at, and want to get your feedback to make sure that my questions are you still for your purposes.  doctor Kirkland said that we can have access to any information that they have on the students, and they have extensive information on the students.  he mentioned that we could use things like their county of residence, their test scores on the entrance exams, ETC.  take a look at the quiz and tell me if there's anything you think we should add, or if there's anything that you think would be useful for your generation.
the quiz will be disbursed this week and should be back by Friday.
I'll see you tomorrow with your mouse!

	HI Matt,
Please send me answers to Melissa's questions AND a diagram of the stand for the iPads for Melissa to see. If you already sent it to me, excuse me for asking twice. But I think I do not have it.  Note #3, I already sent her the info off the MICA site that describes @ the Trails, so if you would give us a more detailed press release that would be great. i.e., write it up and mention SEED School of MD, and teacher(s?) names you are working with. Make a line about the new MICA MFA program. this makes for a good press release and multiple partners ad interest. Also include your 2 yr coordination with CAA (us).  I will also use this writing to put in the CAA newsletter (circulation over 600).   AND send me potential reception/opening dates ASAP #5, and we'll get back to you on the date that works with the city and this can also be included in the info.  I would call that date:  CURATOR's TALK and or MICA MTG  or something or other. You are the guy to know what it is.  DO NOT CALL RECEPTION.  


So send ALL info back to me and I will keep the channels open and Lili and I will help as needed.


BTW- how's it all going.
sue


So use her notes below and fill in all the spaces for me. 


 I have a couple of questions.
 
1−−∙         I thought I would see a sketch of the stand before it was constructed.  I am thrilled it will be on wheels. 
 
2−−∙         This app is available to anyone right? Can I use my cell phone to do the project? If so, can we get ‘directions’ to have a the Vollmer Center to encourage visitors to try it?
 
3−−∙         Can I get a press release about this so we can share it with my Department? I am working hard to share our activities.
 
4−−∙         Also on his abstract, I would prefer that he not reference the greenhouses if this is a public document.  Because the greenhouses are NOT open to the public, I try to make very few references to them in publication.   I have learned (the hard way) that to list them on any type of visitor material implies that they can be visited. 
 
5−−∙         As for the meeting to held in the Mansion, can you give me some idea what week and roughly what time he is interested in and I can give some possibilities or he can give me 3-4 possibilities and I can check the availability. Also about how many people?
 
Thanks again for this update. I like that is all laid out for me and does not rely on my memory.

	hi Susan,
I've got all the documents that you asked for and have written responses to the questions that she has asked. I am not able to write emails from my computer (I'm writing from phone) where are all of the documents are located at the moment because there is no wifi where I am, but as soon as I and back at in a wifi zone I will send you all of the documents.

	Hi Sue,
Thanks for this email.  I have attached all of the requested materials.

Things are going okay.  I'm heading to meet with my educational adviser on this project, Emily Blumenthal from the Walters, in about 20 minutes.  I'm really starting to feel the pinch on this timeline.  I wish I had another 6 months... oh well.

 I have a couple of questions.
 
1−−∙         I thought I would see a sketch of the stand before it was constructed.  I am thrilled it will be on wheels. 
  I have included screenshots of the design and the rendering of the 3-D model if you have google Sketchup to view the model.
2−−∙         This app is available to anyone right? Can I use my cell phone to do the project? If so, can we get ‘directions’ to have a the Vollmer Center to encourage visitors to try it?
 The app is only designed to work on apple products.  Therefore, for the duration of the show,iPhone 4's will be available on weekends from the carriage house. The app is available via the itunes store for anyone with an iphone,.

Directions will be included on a flier that will be placed on the Vollmer Visitor Center reference Desk.  There will also be a 24" x 36" poster hung on an easel (so it can be moved for events) that will have a brief line advertising the download of the app.  


3−−∙         Can I get a press release about this so we can share it with my Department? I am working hard to share our activities.
 Press release attached. 
4−−∙         Also on his abstract, I would prefer that he not reference the greenhouses if this is a public document.  Because the greenhouses are NOT open to the public, I try to make very few references to them in publication.   I have learned (the hard way) that to list them on any type of visitor material implies that they can be visited. 
 Eventually this document will be housed on the Curatorial Practice website for transparency and elucidation of the program's projects.  I can remove any reference to the use or rental of the greenhouse.  No problem! 
5−−∙         As for the meeting to held in the Mansion, can you give me some idea what week and roughly what time he is interested in and I can give some possibilities or he can give me 3-4 possibilities and I can check the availability. Also about how many people?
 Ideally this program would occur on May 15th in the late afternoon or early evening.  I am not particular about it being the mansion (although that would be ideal)  I also know that CAA has the Vollmer visitor's center, for which I would only ask permission to use the upstairs section, and will not need access to the main theater.

	Wonderful!  How about we meet up at 1 PM?  Thanks for being so flexible.  
Have you had any luck tracking down a good person to work with from the Master Naturalists list?  I have a stipend prepared for them, if necessary to compensate them for their time.

See you Tuesday at 1 PM.

1---is the stand ON WHEELS!  it looks top heavy. I can't imagine putting wheels on small base.  AND you are supposed to have directions and places to put your pamphlets and info ON THE STAND.  what happened to the rectangle unit that would hold and display all your materials??


2--- The attachment is NOT press release. It is a repeat of my details to you. Please send press release as requested asap. and with info I requested to be a part of it.


3---is there any way to make app accessible to other cell phones?  besides apple iPhones


4--   may 15 doesn't work.  The week immediately before or after our big Market Day (May11)  is not good.  We are looking at dates for you last week of April or earlier.  We will send you choice of 3 April dates by end of this week.  


Thanks

	Hi Sue, 
1-  That model wasn't up to date.  I've updated the model and provided an image.  I should have been clear with how exactly the design will differ from what you see.  Instead of doing that though, I scoured the warehouse of components that are free to use and included some stand-in renderings onto the model.  The model won't look exactly like this, because I lack the rendering skills to pull off the details required, but it is close to what I'm thinking.

Essentially the bottom is going to be the base of an office chair with a metal pipe extension. That solution is simple, cheap, and quick.  It should provide the stability required, though I'll consider adding additional weight to the bottom, just in case.

2- I'm not sure what happened with the press release.  I checked the document... maybe I sent the wrong file? Anyway, I'm sorry about that.  I have attached the file again.  Should be fine now.

3- Unfortunately, no.  It is out of my budget/timeline to be able to create multiple versions of this program.  Android and Iphone use completely different languages and it has been a struggle for sure figuring out what is possible for this project.  I wish it were possible for multiple platforms.  

4- Okay, I would appreciate it if you would shoot some dates over.  Let's see what we can work out.

Thanks!
Matt

	Hi Justin,
I'm just checking in in prep for tomorrow's visit with your 5th(?) period tech class.  I've recruited an aide from Cylburn's Master Naturalist program to help me run breakout sessions tomorrow.  I have a rubrik and activities planned, and I just want to go over some details pertaining to that plan so that we are on the same page as I come in tomorrow.  I am a much more effective communicator on the phone than on email.  Can we chat today to go over details?  I am available any time after 12 PM.  Call me at your convenience today at 502-552-5981.

If you would prefer to email details, I can do that as well, but I am slow when it comes to constructing emails, which slows down our progress and communication.  

Thanks, Justin

	Hey Matt,

I just shot an email to Jallon so that she and I can discuss a couple of details.  We were out of school for two days last week for "snow," which means tomorrow is an MSA testing day.  I'm fairly sure that won't be an issue for 5th period, but I need to double-check with her, to be sure.  As soon as I hear from her, I'll reach out to you.  Sorry for the confusion--things have been very hectic around here given testing and the "snow" days.

Talk to you soon,
Justin Eames

	Hi Eloise,
Thank you so much for your interest in helping me engage with the SEED school, especially on such short notice.  I understand that you have experience working with Lili at Cylburn's Summer Camp, and essentially I will be asking you to work in much the same way with this group of students.  Many of them have not spent any significant amount of time in "nature", so I am primarily interested in providing general information about nature for these students.  I specifically want to engage the students with an exercise that explains dendrochronology and uses a short drawing exercise to relate that information to the students.  

I would really like to discuss the goals of this day with you so that we are clear about all of the details.  Can you please call me at your convenience time time today after 12 PM? My # is 502-552-5981

Again, thank you so much for your help.  I appreciate your assistance immensely.

Abstract- This isn’t the only attempt I made to acquire iphones or other tech for my thesis, but it is the most significant effort that I made, so it is the one I am including in this list.  The other avenues that I tried were sumply trying to purchase or rent the products from “alibaba” and “rent-a-computer”.  None of these options were viable.  This email chain started in February and continued for several weeks.  Ultimately, I had phone contact with the district coordinator for Verizon in the Baltimore area.  They were unable to support my project in any significant way.

	Team,
    Mr. Spalding came into our fort ave store today with a special request from us at Verizon. He needs from us 10 to 20 iphones 4 or 4s on active data plans for one month April 19 through May 15th. He created an educational app for Iphones that will allow the user to walk a large selection of the facility and as they pass trees the app will provide information on them. 
  
    The Iphones are needed for the visitors that do not have them and for a few schools children that will be going through on tours. 
 
   Exposure will be on company website, street banners we provide and flyers. On market day 2000 plus people will be in attendance. 
 
    This is unique so I am not sure who to put this in the hands of. Any help would be great. Thanks,

	Hello all, 
As Christopher told you all, I am interested in partnering with Verizon on a very unique project.  I approached Chris inquiring about the potential for Verizon to sponsor my Thesis project.  I am aware of the Verizon Foundation online grant opportunity, but my understanding is that type of support in strictly monetary.  I am looking for another type of support from Verizon, I am requesting in-kind support of my project.

Specifically, I am seeking Verizon to loan my project, which partners Cylburn Arboretum, Maryland SEED School, and Maryland Institute college of art.  I am specifically requesting that Verizon support this project by loaning 10-20 iPhone 4's or later and in-kind data for these phones for a term of one month.  I am not sure what type of information you need about my project, so I have attached my proposal to this email.  

This project has many opportunities for exposure to show Verizon's support for this project.  Cylburn Arboretum is located at 4915 Greenspring Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21209.  It is one of the primary venues for events for many City of Baltimore activities and seminars.  Their calendar is usually full because of how often the city uses this venue.  Cylburn is also located almost directly across the street from Sinai Hospital, so there will be a great deal of exposure through street advertising on Greenspring lane.  The places to advertise Verizon's support of this project include:
      * 24" x 36" street banner located on Greenspring ave. 
      * Fliers and handouts at the Vollmer Visitor center at Cylburn Arboretum
      * Through a sponsor page located on Cylburn's website and linked to through the app
      * A poster at the Vollmer Visitor center.  
      * In American Alliance of Museums publication
Once again, I'm not sure what kind of documentation you need from me, so I have attached my proposal for this project.  It explains the scope of the project and how I am coordinating with all of my partners.  If there is any further information that you need or would like to speak to me in person or on the phone, I am more than willing.  I'm excited to hear back from you all.  Thanks!

	Hi Chris, Diane, and Thorpe, 
I have not heard any response from you about this sponsorship opportunity.  Time is ticking down and I will be sending out the press release very soon.  I would love to list Verizon as a sponsor of this project.  Since last you heard from me, I have been approached by "Where Magazine" out of DC, which is a tourist magazine that lists attractions in the DC area to a world-wide audience.  I think this is an exciting opportunity for Verizon.  Please call me at your earliest convenience or email me so that I can clarify the opportunities for Verizon.  Once again, I am asking that Verizon LOAN 10-20 iPhone 4 or better and data plans for one month for these connected phones.  Please contact me so we can move on this.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

I need to speak with them ASAP about the details so that this can all come to fruition.  

Please pass along this new contact information as soon as you can.  Also, I haev not heard anything from them, so I would like to ensure that my contact info has also been passed along.  Again, it is:

	Hi Justin,
Here are a few things about the project that have happened lately that you might find interesting-

Where Magazine out of DC has asked to include the project in their travel guide for visitors to the DC area.  That is very exciting and will provide great exposure.  That reminds me, do you have a 300 dpi image of the sketch video you sent to me?  I  would like to pass that along to them.  They have a quick turn-around time, so this weekend would be ideal.

I received a grant to help fund this project.  $700!  Which means this project and its programming is now fully funded!

How is the artwork generation going?  Was the excel spreadsheet useful to you?  Do you need more info?

Just checking in,
Matt

	Hey Matt,


Sorry I've been slow responding, I've been stressing out trying to keep my thesis on schedule. I'm sorry I wasn't able to get a higher quality video to you, but actually that was the highest quality I was able to capture with my computer. Because the visuals are rendered real-time (and because I'm still optimizing the performance), capturing the video is really tough because I'm forcing the computer to do way more than it wants to.


Aaaand I just realized that you wanted an image, not a higher quality video. Sorry I misread that when I first got your email. I can't get it to reach anything close to 300 dpi but I got a better quality image. That's great about the grant and all the other stuff. Stuff on my end is going well. I've got two complete versions running well on the Nexus7 and working to integrate the info you gave me. BTW do we have an ETA for the androids? It'd be really useful (necessary) to test on the actually device I'm making the programs for.


Thanks,

Thanks for your quick response Libby! I’d like to use the @ The Trails image, but the file size is not big enough. Do you have it any larger? (at least 300 dpi at a 4x6 size)

Also, would you mind explaining a bit more about this image and exhibition? When visitors go to the arboretum, will they see these types of images or will they use the online application as they walk through the space---or both? Is the application something they would download to smartphones? And how is the image related to the application? I’m not super tech savvy, so I apologize if any of these questions have obvious answers!

	hi Libby,
I will get those to her as soon as possible. This show has sent me well behind schedule and I am struggling to get everything together for it and for this most recent request for images.
I will have them to you by Monday at the latest.
thanks, as always, and have a good weekend!

	Here are 3 images they can choose from.  I hope the formatting is correct now.  I contacted my artist for updated images, but I didn't hear back from him over the weekend.  Once I hear from him, I will pass those images along to you.  In the meantime, as I mentioned before, here are 3 useable images.

	Thanks, Matt! I had forwarded the image of Justin Livi's artwork to the reporter, but it's too small for them to use. It looks like the app rendering is also too small. I'll forward the image of the center, but hopefully you'll get something later today that is more representative of the exhibition!

	Let's aim for Thursday, I'm not feeling better yet. 


Question, did sue ask you about April 23rd for your reception?


Also, how do you want people to contact you about the Thursday hours. They are putting an article in the newsletter about your project, and they are asking about reserving the phones. I told them check out from nature museum, but I don't want to give your email if that isn't how you want to be contacted.


Thanks,
Lili

	Thursday is a totally free day for me this week, so that will work well.  I hope you feel better soon!

I'm glad to hear about the newsletter.  I was also contacted by Where Magazine, which is a travel mag out of DC.  They would ike to feature Cylburn and my project in their upcoming issue.  Neat!

Sue didn't ask me about April 23rd, but that will work for me I suppose.  I will coordinate with her to determine a time.

As far as people contacting me for iphones, you can definitely give out my email, though please don't pass along my cell #.

Hi Diane,
Thank you for sending this out to your marketing team.  I am sending this email as a follow-up to see how the process is moving along.  If you could please pass along the contact information for whoever is moving forward with this project within Verizon. I need to speak with them ASAP about the details so that this can all come to fruition.  

Please pass along this new contact information as soon as you can.  Also, I haev not heard anything from them, so I would like to ensure that my contact info has also been passed along.  Again, it is:

	Hi Ms. Hilton and Ms. Robinson,
I haven't heard anything from you about this project in a couple of days.  As I said before, at this point I am getting short on time to get all of my ducks in a row for this project.  Please get in touch with me at your earliest convenience.  If you'd like, I can give you a call as well.  All I need is a contact number and I would be thrilled to call you to work out some details.  Please don't let this go by the wayside, I am very dedicated to this project and think it is a good opportunity for Verizon as well.
Thank you, I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,

Matt Spalding

	Hello Melanie, 
Thank you for reaching out and showing interest in my project.  I am glad that I was finally able to connect with the right person from Verizon.  As per your request, I have laid out the extent of the relevant parts of the project in this email.  Thank you again for your interest.
As you know, I am interested in partnering with Verizon on a very unique project. I am aware of the Verizon Foundation online grant opportunity, but my understanding is that type of support in strictly monetary. I am looking for another type of support from Verizon, I am requesting in-kind support of my project.
Specifically, I am seeking Verizon to loan my project, which partners Cylburn Arboretum, Maryland SEED School, and Maryland Institute college of art. I am specifically requesting that Verizon support this project by loaning 10-20 iPhone 4's or later and in-kind data for these phones for a term of one month. I am not sure what type of information you need about my project, so I have attached my proposal to this email.
To abbreviate your reading though, I will break down the phases of this project:
* Visitors to the Cylburn Arboretum will be invited to download the @ the Trails app, which is designed to help visitors interact with the collection of notable trees scattered across the grounds of Cylburn Arboretum.  The app is designed to work with 10 trees around the grounds.  Each tree has a unique activity that users are asked to complete.  Many of these activities rely on technology found in the Iphone to work.
* The app is designed to facilitate the movement of participants around the outdoor space using bluetooth signals placed in the outdoor space.  The app finds the bluetooth signals in much the same way that radar is used. The app records visitor movement using the built in GPS in the Iphone.
* The app is designed to collect data from the use of this app.  That data will be collected for one month and then given to the students at the SEED school of Maryland students.  These students will take this data and visualize it into graphics that will be displayed at a later date in one of Cylburn Arboretum's exhibition spaces. 
This project has many opportunities for exposure to show Verizon's support for this project. Cylburn Arboretum is located at 4915 Greenspring Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21209. It is one of the primary venues for events for many City of Baltimore activities and seminars. Their calendar is usually full because of how often the city uses this venue. Cylburn is also located almost directly across the street from Sinai Hospital, so there will be a great deal of exposure through street advertising on Greenspring lane. The places to advertise Verizon's support of this project include:
*Featured in Where Magazine
* 24" x 36" street banner located on Greenspring ave. 
* Fliers and handouts at the Vollmer Visitor center at Cylburn Arboretum 
*Through a sponsor page located on Cylburn's website and linked to through the app 
*A poster at the Vollmer Visitor center. 
*In American Alliance of Museums publication


I have attached my proposal for this project. It explains the scope of the project and how I am coordinating with all of my partners. If there is any further information that you need or would like to speak to me in person or on the phone (502) 552-5981, I am more than willing. I'm excited to hear back from you. Thanks!

	Hi Melanie,
this is Matt Spalding again seeing if you got my email about my project and if you have any questions. I haven't heard anything from you or Erika Robinson since last we spoke, so I want to make sure that this is still on your plate. Do you have any questions that I could answer for you? Is there anything I need to clear up?  please get back in touch with me at your earliest convenience. You have my number, (502) 552-5981, and I am very anxious to move this process along.  thank you again for your time, interest, and patience. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Regards,
Matt Spalding

	I've made great progress with Verizon, although I'm still getting passed around a bit. That's not confirmed, but looking good.
My Bluetooth provider doesn't have floor motels to guide me. They're doing the best they can, but their shipment is over a month late. I've got my fingers crossed and have done all o can. I'm keeping on them.

Please let me know as the event is quickly approaching.  as always, if you have any questions feel free to email or call anytime (502)552-5981.  thanks again! I look forward to hearing from you soon.

	Hi Lili,
Sorry I have been lax about getting back to you with a date.  I have decided that it's not a requirement and I don't think I should be worrying about it.  We can just hae the market day as the central focus so that nothing has to change.  I hope that's okay.  I don't want you to think that all of the effort that you and Susan went through to put those options together was unnoticed or unappreciated.  I think I was just worrying over it for no reason, and then I rudely placed an additional burden on you.  I'm sorry for that. 
I'm glad you're going on a vacation.  This is the perfect time to do it, and I'm sure you need it, considering how long you've been single-handedly coordinating all of the events at Cylburn.  When do you leave?  Will we be able to meet this week?

	Hi Matt,


We likely won't know what the writer focused on until the issue comes out. She was interested in several of the MFA in Curatorial Practice thesis projects in addition to yours, so it seems like she may be featuring them together. This is the information I gave her after we spoke:


I reached out to the student curator, Matt Spalding, who is working on sending me some images of the app. I'm hoping to be able to forward those along tomorrow. He explained that when visitors arrive at the arboretum, an exhibition featuring six of Justin Levi's artworks will be on display on tablets. In conjunction with the exhibition, visitors have the ability to download an app to their smartphones that sends them on a search for 10 different trees important to the arboretum's collection. When the visitor finds a tree, there is an activity to go along with it. So to put it simply, there are 10 different activities for 10 different trees.

If it is concerning your Seminar class tomorrow, it is obviously too late to be of any help.
If not, the only timeslot to meet  tomorrow I have now is at 4:30 after Gabrielle's exit interview.
We leave for the first year weekend field trip early Friday morning and return late Sunday.

So I've thought about this a lot and talked about it with a number of friends and teachers and I've decided I don't feel comfortable continuing with the exhibition. I can return the tablet at your convenience.


Thank you for the opportunity and good luck,

I understand your frustration with how the postcards turned out. I definitely did not want it to appear that I was the artist and not you. My thesis is hanging on by a thread right now, and that thread is you participating. I will literally do whatever it takes to keep you on this project. Please reconsider and let me know what I can do.

	Hi Justin, 
First, thank you for the cordiality of you recent message.  Looking at the situation from any point of view gives you every right to be livid, as I acknowledged yesterday.  Please hear me out to the end of this email.  
When you contacted me about the representation of your work on the postcard, I was not pretending to be completely blindsided by what was printed.  I honestly hadn't looked very closely at it, because I was not the designer of the materials.  Like every other grad student, I was asked to submit images and a summary of the my thesis.  I made the assertion that grad studies must have miss-credited the image, I can PROVE that I credited you in the materials that I sent to them.  
I've forwarded the original email that has the image list and write up.  It is all accessible through Google drive, which I believe keeps a record or edits.  You will see that the document has not been edited since the day I sent it on January 14th, and that you images for the press materials (images 3, 4, and 5 of the thesis packet),  These were all credited to you, as you can see at the bottom of the document entitled Spading_matthew_statement.doc.docx.  You'll also note that they named your image after "screenshot #1", which was clearly listed for a completely different image!  
When you were texting me about the issue, it really was completely unaware of the discrepancy.  I claimed over text that no one's artist's work from our thesis program had been attributed.  I made that statement because I didn't remember the press packet criteria back to Jan 11th very clearly.  That was false.  I later looked  because   again, I hadn't examined the card very closely.  Now that it has been brought to my attention, I asked Patrick Stewart whether I could get it reprinted.  He told me that the cost of printing just one set of postcards would be thousands of dollars because they are all custom paper, set, etc.  I can't get an edited postcard printed and have it in the same format.  I CAN print a whole new set of postcards with corrected information.  These postcards won't be in the same style as the incorrect postcards, which will be immediately destroyed, but will be updated to reflect what your work actually looks like for this exhibition.
I don't think I have to tell you what is on the line here for me, and what MICA has invested in this show.  This mistake, which can be called an oversight at worst- not malicious misrepresentation- was certainly a shock to discover.  Clearly I am committed to representing your work in the best possible way- I bought 6 android tablets just to do so! I appreciate the feelings and the position you took in your previous email, but I would like you to look at the emails I have forwarded to you and the documents I have shared so that you can see with full transparency what occurred way back in January.  Please think about the evidence and the weight of the decision you are making.  It will have an impact on my own future, the future of my program, as well as MICA as an institution.  
Please respond when you have come to a conclusion or if you have any questions about the documents I have sent you.

	Also, because your main compensation (exposure through the project) has been muddled, is there another form of compensation that appeals to you?  Financial or otherwise?  You had mentioned to me the other day that you would be interested in "taking the tablets off my hands".  I think we can still work something out.

n/a (mspalding@mica.edu) submitted feedback.
Name:
Matt Spalding
Comments:
I contributed to the StickNFind campaign on December 14, 2012. I was told that the items would arrive in March of 2013. I have had very minimal contact with the StickNFind manufacturers, although I have attempted to contact them numerous times. When I was contacted to say they were shipping out, I was promised a routing number so I could track the items. When I asked for a routing number, I was again returned with silence. At this point I&#x27;m worried about the StickNFind campaign being fraudulent and want to know what my options are. I would love to get a phone number for StickNFind so that I can contact them directly versus waiting on someone to respond to an email. When I&#x27;ve asked for one from them they have not given it to me. 
The whole reason I am so desperate is that I was planning on using these items in my Master&#x27;s Thesis which opens next Friday. I need these bluetooth devices asap. Is there anyway you could contact them or give me their contact phone number?
Thank you!
Matt

	Hi Matt, I'm sorry it took me a little while to get back to you but I wanted to get a number of opinions from other people before making a decision. I still don't feel comfortable taking part and the general concensus of feedback I've received supports this decision. If you'd like me to speak to your advisor as well I'd be happy to. I was actually planning on contacting him, but if you don't think that'd be necessary I won't bother.

	Matt- I was without cell reception yesterday and just read your text messages.
I reviewed the emails you sent and Justin's stand on his participation.
We are still on our field trip and will try and call you later on one of our breaks.
Not sure if you followed up with Lili and Sue to give them a heads- up on the status of things
even though you did not meet with them on Friday. If not, you need to do so asap and copy me.
Attempt to schedule a meeting with them on Monday at 3:30 after Hyejung's Thesis evaluation.
You need to also schedule a meeting on Tuesday at 3:30 if possible for us with Erin and Bob
for us to discuss if and how your situation may effect your degree completion.
Lastly, you may want to request for us to meet with CP 13 for us to explore
what if any options there might be regarding thesis completion at this stage.
Perhaps at lunch break Monday

	Lili and Susan,
Despite my best efforts, insurmountable problems have arisen in the last week.  These problems were completely unpredictable for me, and we need to talk about damage control asap. 
Specifically, the problems are that my artist bailed on me a week before the opening and the bluetooth equipment to run the app still hasn't arrived, despite multiple attempts to contact the company. I'm currently filling a claim with indiegogo, because I'm thinking they might be a fraudulent company.
I believe Lili is out of town for vacation all this week, but of that's not true, I'd like to meet with you both Monday at 3:30 (preferable) our as early as possible.  
I'm sorry to have put you into this position.

	Hi Sue,
First, thank you for meeting today too talk about what can be done with what we have for this opening on Friday.  I'm meeting with my group to make sure that we have something worth seeing available to the public on Friday.
secondly, have you heard anything from your family in Boston? I hope they are okay.
third, do you have a blank map that I can use to put together a guided tour map for this project? I want it to be the same quality as the other maps that you have for your site. how can I get a hold of one of those?

ABOUT
@ the Trails is an exhibition that will educate, engage, and inspire.  Through the use of a digital platform prompted by QR codes and  temporary outdoor signage, visitors can explore Cylburn Arboretum’s outdoor space and extensive collection of trees to discover various principles of nature, the history of Cylburn Arboretum, and practices of stewardship in an artful experience that both educates and inspires. @ the Trails will discover the emerging role that technology plays in either supplementing or hindering participants’ experience of nature and interactive art.


INSTRUCTIONS
Use the @ the Trails map to guide you through the arboretum to take this educational tour.  Locate the ten activity sites and, with your tablet or smartphone, scan each of the branded QR codes. This will prompt a series of games and exercises that will let you explore Cylburn in a whole new way. Good luck and have fun!


CREDIT
@ the Trails was organized by Matt Spalding in conjunction with his thesis work for his MFA in Curatorial Practice at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). @ the Trails was conceived in partnership with Cylburn Arboretum and sponsored in part by the Office of Community Engagement at MICA. This exhibition was also made possible with consultation from artist, Justin Livi.

Based on what I understand from the data you collected, I came up with a multi-step process with flexibility for you and the teachers to work with.
I included silly diagrams to help convey ideas. Let me know what you think, I can also meet in person.

	Hi Joe,
I'm sorry to bother you on your vacation.  I hope it is going well. I would have called, but it is near dinner time and I don't want to disturb you.

I've determined that the best course of action is to get 6 tablets, which I already own, signed up for month-to-month data plans for the duration of my thesis project.  I believe that this cost would be $290 for all six, and that you would be willing to waive the activation fee- which I greatly appreciate.  I plan to go into a verizon store as soon as I get confirmation of this plan from you.  

Thanks again for your help shepherding this project along.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Either call (502-552-5981) or email at you earliest convenience.

	Hi again Joe,
I can make it over to Verizon today at 4:30. Will Chris still be there at that time? He'll be at the one off of Fort avenue, right? 
Thanks again. I hope your sunburn is easing.

	Again there was a great deal of progress made today.  Everyone contributed, and I can't thank you all enough, but I can start by just simply saying thank you all.  
Some of the accomplishments from today:
*The map is in its draft form and is being reviewed by Cylburn. With just a few tweaks, it should be ready to go! 
*All of the activities have been uploaded onto URL and will function on all androids and tablets!
* 10 QR codes have been developed 
Google spreadsheets have been linked to the activities to assist in data collection
* Obsolete postcards have been meticulously removed and all MICA materials able to be altered have been altered.
* All materials needed for temporary outdoor signage have been acquired
* A lesson plan was developed using the data originally intended for use in Justin Livi's work.  It is now going to be used as a lesson plan for SEED
*New postcards have been designed and ordered>  They should be available for pickup tomorrow.


* Link QR codes to the activities
* I need someone who is authorized to work in the woodshop to meet me down there at some point tomorrow after 12.  Any takers?  I think only a few of you are authorized.
* I'm going to Verizon tomorrow to get the tablets data plans.  


I know there's more to do.  
When I think of it, I"ll add an addendum to this email

not sure if you need a comma between artist and Justin.
Once Cylburn approves and Justin has a chance to confirm this "credit", it 's a go.

	I spotted a couple things here, but for the most part it looks great.
1- on the map "H" should be orange.  It's the one off on the side of the map.
2- "22" should be "32"
3- 32 should be Viburnums, not beeches
I'm extremely pleased with everything else.  Thank you for your work.

	This is the map that we have put together for visitors to use as a supplement for the tour.  
Do you think it is okay?  We wanted to put something together that was similar, but not too similar to the maps that you already have at the Vollmer.  The size is also smaller than your usual maps.  
What do you think of the language we use to describe the project?  Is it clear and does it get the point across for you audience?


We have a few tweaks that we've noticed that need to be fixed before the final printing.  If you find anything, please add it tot he list and it will be corrected.
1- on the map "H" should be orange.  It's the one off on the side of the map.
2- "22" should be "32"
3- 32 should be Viburnums, not beeches
4- The comma in the final credit sentence between artist and Justin Livi should be removed.

	Hi Matt and Mapmakers
A few corrections and questions…..


1--The map looks very good. I think you should have the DATES of your exhibit on it. so people know how long the tour/exhibit is up and running.  
2--And perhaps if successful, is this something that Cylburn can keep?  or do you pay for those QR codes and connectivity once website is developed?
3- should state 2 yr collaboration wf Cylburn Arboretum Association.
4- Freebie- I answered this myself.  But it referred to:  works now on both Platforms? droid and apple. Is this correct?
5- I still need a damage control paragraph or two (separate from this map) to publish for our membership in an e-news.  i.e. lack of generative art display in the vollmer, and the digital arboretum graphics on your individual iPhone as you succeed in answering your tour questions.  i am assuming this will not be taking place.
6- Have you reached Justin Eames to discuss a potential piece of art that will come out of this tour, or a graphic designer at MICA?

	It is important to say that this is a two yr. collaboration (#3 below of my comments-) with CAA and ADD Baltimore City Rec and Parks.   It is important that we get credit (the Assoc) and the city always wants a "call out" to them as well.  One would think to just say Cylburn Arboretum would work, but NOT.  use both organizations. THANKS.

Or transformed version of your thesis- PLEASE WRITE for us the text we could put in our e-news that we will mail out thurs. or Friday to do damage control from our end as your partnering org.


Also- I appreciate your cc 's on your work this week and I'd like to especially thank your classmates in advance,  for committing to help make this a successful partnership.

	The women in my class are really amazing.  I'll pass on that you think so, too.  
I sent you a few new paragraphs for you to look at for this project on the backside of the map that we have designed for this tour.  Does the writing on the back of that map serve your needs, or are you looking for more description?  Just let me know and we'll ensure that your needs are met.

	Hi Sue,
I understand better after rereading your instructions what it is you needed from me for damage control.  I am on it right now and will get it out to you, George, and someone from my program for review ASAP.

	I have altered this write-up to reflect the changes.  it is now accurate to the project.  Is it important to mention that the project has changed, or should that go unsaid?  I'm looking for feedback so I can make this exactly what Sue needs it to be.

	What we need is:  
1-- not a rewrite of our release.  which is ALREADY printed and in the regular mail. can't be changed.
2-- We need a one (or two) paragraph notice of opening of @ the trails that will go out in our abbreviated e-news that just states come and explore this interactive exhibit that has been modified. and state the format and generation of artwork has been changed (as George recommends). The generative artwork will not be included, but a new graphic content display will be created by SEED students utilizing the data from the app.  Something like that. We have NOT cleared a display with the city yet for Market Day.  I would just write at the end of the show, artwork will be displayed that is based on @the trails data sets.


Do you have a definite yes from SEED?  if not, don't say it will be my them in this writeup.




NOTE:   I need ONLY one paragraph or 2  that we can utilize to let the public know the project has CHANGED and what is different. 
Thanks.

Justin, 


I'm writing to clarify the steps that will be taken in the coming weeks to redirect the @ the Trails exhibition after your departure as the lead artist on the project. My first step will be to address any and all press material that has already gone out that may contain your name or artwork. The promotional postcards printed by MICA that have your image on it have already been removed. I will be following up with a list of additional materials and a plan for how these materials will be addressed and rectified. 


The data collected will still be developed into a platform, either by a new artist/designer or by the students at the SEED school. This final product will in no way resemble what you have already developed. Additionally, there will be no artwork hung in the Visitor Center at Cylburn. 


I will be publishing a brochure for the exhibition that will contain an acknowledgements section. I would like your permission to include you in this section to acknowledge the time that you contributed to the project.

My first step will be to address any and all press material that has already gone out that may contain your name or artwork. Your name and images will be removed in any place that it is possible. The promotional postcards printed by MICA that have your image on it have already been removed, though about 50 have already gone out, mostly to in-house MICA affiliates. A MICA affiliated email will be going out explaining that you are no longer involved in the project. The only press with your name/image that has gone out and cannot change is the Juxtapositions newsletter and a brief article in DC's Where Magazine. I will be following up with a list of additional materials and a plan for how these materials will be addressed and rectified.

I'll be publishing a brochure for the exhibition that will contain an acknowledgements section and I'd like to get your permission to include you in this section. I appreciate your time and collaboration to this project.

Justin, 
 
I'm writing to clarify the steps that will be taken in the coming weeks to redirect the @ the Trails exhibition after your departure as the lead artist on the project. My first step will be to address any and all press material that has have already gone out that may contain your name or artwork. Your name and images will be removed in any place that it is possible. The promotional postcards printed by MICA that have your image on it them have already been removed, though about 50 have already gone out, mostly to in-house MICA affiliates. A MICA affiliated email will be going out explaining that you are no longer involved in the project. The only press with your name/image that has gone out and cannot change is the Juxtapositions newsletter and a brief article in DC's Where Magazine. I will be following up with a list of additional materials and a plan for how these materials will be addressed and rectified.

I will be publishing a take-away for the exhibition that will contain an acknowledgements section. I would like your permission to include you in this section to acknowledge the time that you contributed to the project. You can see how you are acknowledged on the project in the following paragraph, which is included on the take-away:


CREDIT
@ the Trails was organized by Matt Spalding in conjunction with his thesis work for his MFA in Curatorial Practice at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). @ the Trails was conceived in partnership with Cylburn Arboretum and sponsored in part by the Office of Community Engagement at MICA. This exhibition was also made possible with consultation from artist, Justin Livi. 
Let me know if this is okay for you, if you'd like something changed, or if you'd like to have the entire section removed. 

I'm getting this all printed in the morning, so a quick response is needed.

That's very considerate of you. The section is great and I'm glad that the project is able to continue without me. I'm sorry that things ended up turning out the way they did, but I think it's for the best.
Wishing you well and best of luck,

	I'm confused what you mean.  Are you asking if we made the edits to the map?  We have been sending you changes because you have the program to edit.  It's not a problem if I need to make the changes, I just want to be clear about who is making the changes that we have been sending back and forth for the last couple of days.  Have you been getting those emails?  I think all of the edits are in, so once they're made we're good to go.
Let me know if that's my  responsibility or yours.  I can do it, I am just looking for clarification.  Also, either way it's my money that needs to go to get them printed.

list Cylburn Arboretum Association and Baltimore City Department of Recreation and Parks as sponsors-  
The "damage control" paragraph is attached to this email

	Can I meet you to get them printed?  I'd hate for you to have to pay for them, even though I will pay you back.  It's just easier for me to pay for them at printing, I think.

Abstract- Sue sent this email to ask what the plan was for the morning.  I pledged to bring the poster and handouts in the morning.  I didn’t end up printing the poster.  The resolution was too low, because I lost dpi through the course of 10,000 resaves.

	Hi sue and Lili,
Glad you asked. All of the major work is completed. My main task in the morning is to print the maps and the poster. The tech center opens at 8 am. As soon as those materials are finished printing i am mounting the poster on foam core and then buying a classy easel and coming straight over. I hotter to be completely set up with signs in the vollmer and site markets installed by noon.  It's looking good!

	Could you please run the map and poster by me (a pdf) so I can preview.  Especially since you haven't printed it yet.  I am going to bed now, but I'll respond in AM before you head out to printers.
Glad it is coming together.  Call Lili before you buy an easel. We have some nice looking ones.


I will be at Cylburn 9:30 to 11 ish. Call my cell when you arrive at Cylburn or have map questions. if i have comments.

	Hi Justin and Jallon, 
I'm just checking in to confirm that everything is still on for next Thursday's trip out to Cylburn. I do have to tell you that instead of iphones, the students will be given tablets to complete the activities for the day, but hopefully that won't be too much of a shift for them and they will just go with the flow.  I know they were very excited about using the iphones, but these tablets should perform just as well, if not better, because of their larger screen size.
I am planning to break the students into smaller groups again.  Three groups should work very nicely, but I will have to be more conscious of the way the students are dividing themselves into groups, because the groups were uneven when the students were allowed to organize themselves into groups. 
The break down of activities with the students is:
1- walk around and complete educational activities using the tablets, generating data for later use
2 - lesson in the classroom reinforcing ideas about ecology that have previously been discussed
3- With a guide, tour Cylburn's gardens and begin to develop a plan for the types of plants the students would like in their own garden (Called the "Smart Garden", which has already been supported through a grant)
Students will rotate between these activities until all students get to participate in all 3 activities


Furthermore, and it is important that we determine this quickly, there is an opportunity for students to exhibit some data visualizations in conjunction with this project at this year's Market Day at Cylburn Arboretum on May 11th.  Market Day is Cylburn's largest event, and would be a great place to show the creativity and work of SEED school students.  Justin, I know that previously we had talked about your students creating data visualizations from data collected from this project.  Is there an opportunity to move the timeline up and have a few students create work using data that I have already collected through our collaboration?  Let me know as soon as you can.  I realize the school year is getting close to completion, so we will have to start on this very, very soon.  I have included some links for easy data visualization websites and tools to help you in this endeavor.
Thanks for reading this long update all the way through.  I look forward to hearing back from you soon!
Matt Spalding

	Hi justin,
Did you also happen to see the part of my email about the data visualizations?  it's toward the bottom.  The question was about the possibility of getting some renderings of data sets that I can provide related to this project for the Market Day at Cylburn on May 11th.

	Matt a couple of corrections before you head to the printers today.




1-  POSTER:   ADD WORD "Association"  
At the very bottom, in paragraph where you mention Justin Livi-  you said… conceived in partnership with Cylburn Arboretum and Balto Rec and Parks. 
IT NEEDS TO SAY
in partnership with Cylburn Arboretum Association and Baltimore City Rec and Parks.  Obviously NOT "bolded font" in your poster.




2-  POSTER
Is it an iPhone app, or just a "cell phone app"  ?  so is "download Cylburn iPhone app"  In the BIG FONT at bottom of the poster wrong? and does that give droid owners the wrong idea that it is not for them?  




3-  MAP
If not too late, and if so- just leave as is.  "L"  the Black walnut is not located properly. Sorry I just noticed this. The walnut in circle came down 2 years ago. But the 3 trees near by outside the circle contains a black walnut. So you could move "L" to the middle tree just outside the circle.




4-  MAP
Correction to next to last paragraph.  ADD word… ASSOCIATION.  see comment number one above. It is the same paragraph and needs the same correction.  Cylburn Arboretum Association and B C R P.




5- MAP
Your asterisk paragraph explaining the changes.  THis paragraph is for our e-news.  On this map it is inappropriate.  Please shorten it and and only say….


* Please note the generative artwork will not be on display at the Vollmer Visitor Center.  Instead, data visualizations will be produced at the end of the show and will be displayed based on @ the Trails data sets.


Reason to only say this one sentence…. is that most of the public will not know what was previously mailed out (only our membership)  Thus no need to dwell on past promises and make a point of stating that it is not being accomplished publicly.  The project is interesting enough and still substantial.


THANKS. PLEASE MAKE ALL THESE CORRECTIONS.  
sue

	Notes-
The selection buttons for activity o come up a little skewed on the phone.  Can we make them any smaller to fit?
Content for activity "d" still needs to be filled in- that's more a note for me than it is for you :)
Activity "b" has a lot of edits.  it needs a new picture set

10 am is fine with me. Do we need inside space or do we think this is going to be outside looking at the project? Where should we meet at Cylburn?

It would be ideal if  we could meet from 10-12 at Clyburn with Lili and you.
Matt's peers will also be present, as they are at all of our thesis evaluations with the review committees. 
They will meet without the committee from 1-3 with Matt and me to discuss the morning feedback and discussion.


Hope this is doable at this late date.
If it is better for both of you to meet instead from 1-3, let me know and we will accommodate that somehow.

	Hi Matt and George,
Since the arboretum is closed on Mondays, you will have to come in the Cylburn Avenue, yellow gate. Also, since we are closed, the class should carpool as much as they can.
